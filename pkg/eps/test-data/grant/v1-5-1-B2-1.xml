<heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pearlite rail which enhances fatigue damage resistance of the head portion and the bottom portion of the rail. In particular, the present invention relates to a pearlite rail which is used for sharp curves in domestic and freight railways overseas.</p>
<heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">With regard to freight railways overseas, in order to achieve high efficiency in railway transportation, a carrying capacity of freight loads has been improved. In particular, in rails used for a section through which a large number of trains passes or for sharp curves, significant wear occurs on a head top portion or a head corner portion of the rail (the periphery of corner of the rail head which intensely contacts with flange portions of wheels). Therefore, there is a problem of a reduction in the service life due to an increase in the amount of wear.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, similarly, in a domestic passenger rails, particularly, in the rail used for sharp curves, the wear progresses remarkably as in the freight railways overseas, so that there is a problem in that the service life is reduced due to an increase in the amount of wear.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">From this background, the development of a rail with high wear resistance is required. In order to solve the problem, a rail as described in Patent Document 1 has been developed. The main characteristic of the rail is that its pearlite structure (lamellar spacing) is made finely by performing a heat treatment in order to increase the hardness of the pearlite structure.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">In Patent Document 1, a technique of performing a heat treatment on a steel rail containing high-carbon steel so as to cause the metallic structure to have a sorbite structure or a fine pearlite structure. Accordingly, by achieving a high hardness of the steel rail, it is possible to provide a rail with excellent wear resistance.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in recent years, further carrying capacity and further high speed of trains of freight loads has been improved for the freight railways overseas and the domestic passenger rails in order to further achieve high efficiency in railway transportation. In the rail described in Patent Document 1, it becomes difficult to ensure the wear resistance of the head portion of the rail, so that there is a problem in that the service life of the rail is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Here, in order to solve the problem, a steel rail with a high carbon amount has been considered. This rail has characteristics such that the wear resistance is enhanced by increasing the volume ratio of cementite in the lamellae of the pearlite structure (for example, refer to Patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In Patent Document 2, a rail which has a pearlite structure as its metallic structure by enhancing a carbon amount of the steel rail to a hypereutectoid region is disclosed. Accordingly, the wear resistance is enhanced by increasing the volume ratio of a cementite phase in the pearlite lamellar, so that a rail with higher service life can be provided. According to the rail described in Patent Document 2, the wear resistance of the rail is enhanced, so that an improvement of definite service life is achieved. However, in recent years, an excessive increase in the density of railway transportation has been progressed, so that the generation of fatigue damage from the head portion or the bottom portion of the rail exists. As a result, although the rail described in Patent Document 2 is used, there is a problem in that the service life of the rail is not sufficient Citation List</p>

<heading id="h0007">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In the pearlite rail described in the above (1), since an amount of 0.65 to 1.20% of C, an amount of 0.05 to 2.00% of Si, and an amount of 0.05 to 2.00% of Mn is contained, it is possible to maintain the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure is maintained and improve a fatigue damage resistance. In addition, a martensite structure which is harmful to fatigue properties is not easily generated, and a reduction in the fatigue limit stress range can be suppressed, so that it becomes possible to enhance fatigue strength.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">In addition, in the pearlite rail, at least part of the head portion and at least part of the bottom portion have a pearlite structure, and the surface hardness of at least part of the head portion and at least part of the bottom portion is in a range of Hv320 to Hv500 and has a maximum surface roughness of less than or equal to 180 µm. Therefore, it becomes possible to enhance the fatigue damage resistance of the rail for the freight railways overseas and the domestic passenger rails.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">In the pearlite rail described in the above (2), since the ratio of the surface hardness to the maximum surface roughness is greater than or equal to 3.5, the fatigue limit stress range is increased, so that it becomes possible to enhance the fatigue strength. Therefore, it becomes possible to further improve the fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite rail.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In the pearlite rail described in the above (3), since the number of concavities and convexities is less than or equal to 40, the fatigue limit stress range is increased, so that the fatigue strength is significantly enhanced.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">In the pearlite rail described in the above (4), since one or two kinds of 0.01 to 2.00% of Cr and 0.01 to 0.50% of Mo are contained, lamellar spacing of the pearlite structure is made finely, so that the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure is improved and generation of the martensite structure which is harmful to the fatigue properties is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> suppressed. As a result, it becomes possible to improve the fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite rail.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">In the pearlite rail described in the above (5), since one or two kinds of 0.005 to 0.50% of V and 0.002 to 0.050% of Nb is contained, austenite grains are made finely, so that toughness of the pearlite structure is improved. In addition, since V and Nb prevent a heat-affected zone of the welding joint from softening, it becomes possible to improve the toughness of the pearlite structure and strength of welded joints.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">In the pearlite rail described in the above (6), since 0.01 to 1.00% of Co is contained, the ferrite structure of the rolling contact surface is made further finely, so that the wear resistance characteristics are improved.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">In the pearlite rail described in the above (7), since 0.0001 to 0.0050% of B is contained, cooling rate dependency of a pearlite transformation temperature is reduced, so that the pearlite rail is provided with a more uniform hardness distribution.

<p id="p0026" num="0026">In the pearlite rail described in the above (12), since 0.0001 to 0.2000% of Zr is contained, the generation of the martensite structure or the pro-eutectoid cementite structure is suppressed in a segregation portion of the pearlite rail.

<heading id="h0009">Description of Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Hereinafter, a pearlite-based rail (a pearlite rail) having excellent wear resistance and fatigue damage resistance according to an embodiment of the invention will be described in detail. Here, the embodiment is not limited to the following description and it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the shapes and details thereof can be modified in various forms without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiment. Therefore, the embodiment is not construed as being limited by the description provided later. Hereinafter, in terms of composition, mass% is simply referred to as %. In addition, as necessary, the pearlite-based rail according to this embodiment is referred to as a steel rail.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">First, the inventors examined situations in which fatigue damage of steel rails in an actual track occurs. As a result, it was confirmed that fatigue damage of a head portion of the steel rail does not occur in a rolling surface which is in contact with wheels but occurs from a surface of a non-contact portion in the periphery thereof. In addition, it was confirmed that fatigue damage of a bottom portion of the steel rail occurs from a surface in the vicinity of a center portion of the bottom portion in a width direction where stress is relatively high. Therefore, it was found that the fatigue damage of the actual track occurs from the head portion and the surface of the bottom portion of a product rail.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Moreover, the inventors showed generation factors of the fatigue damage of the steel rail based on the examination results. It is known that the fatigue strength of steel is generally correlated with a tensile strength (hardness) of steel. Here, a steel rail was produced by using steel having a C amount of 0.60 to 1.30%, a Si amount of 0.05 to 2.00%, and a Mn amount of 0.05 to 2.00% and performing rail rolling and heat treatment thereon, and a fatigue test that the usage conditions of a real track was reproduced. In addition, test conditions are as follows:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>(x1) Rail shape: a steel rail (67 kg/m) of 136 pounds is used.</li>
<li>(x2) Fatigue test<br/>
Test method: a test of three-point bending (span length of 1 m and a frequency of 5 Hz) is performed on an actual steel rail.<br/>
Load condition: stress range control (maximum-minimum, the minimum load is 10% of the maximum load) is performed.</li>
<li>(x3) Test posture: a load is added on a rail head portion (tensile strength is added on a bottom portion).</li>
<li>(x4) Number of repetition: 2 million times, the maximum stress range without fracturing is referred to as a fatigue limit stress range.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Results of the fatigue test of the actual steel rail in three-point bending are shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1. FIG. 1</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between a hardness or a metallic structure of the surface of the bottom portion of the steel rail and a fatigue limit stress range. Here, the surface of the bottom portion of the steel rail is a sole portion 3 shown in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>. Regarding the fatigue limit stress range, as described in above (x2), when the test is performed by varying the load between the maximum stress and the minimum stress, the difference between the maximum stress and the minimum stress is the same as the stress range in the fatigue test, and particularly, as described in above (x4), the maximum stress range without fracturing is as the fatigue limit stress range.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, it was confirmed that the fatigue limit stress range that determines the fatigue properties of steel are correlated with the metallic structure of steel. It was found that the steel rail in a region indicated by the arrow A of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> (bottom portion surface hardness of Hv250 to 300) in which a small amount of ferrite structure is mixed with the pearlite structure, and the steel rail in a region indicated by the arrow C of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> (bottom surface hardness of Hv530 to 580) in which a small amount of martensite structure and pro-eutectoid cementite structure is mixed with the pearlite structure have greatly reduced fatigue limit stress ranges and thus have greatly reduced fatigue strength.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">In addition, in a region indicated by the arrow B of <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> which represents a single phase structure of pearlite (bottom surface hardness of Hv300 to 530), there is a tendency towards the fatigue limit stress range increasing with the surface hardness. However, as the bottom portion surface hardness exceeds Hv500, the fatigue limit stress range is greatly reduced. Therefore, it was found that in order to reliably secure a predetermined fatigue strength, the surface hardness needs to be confined within a predetermined range.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">Moreover, the inventors verified factors that vary the fatigue limit stress ranges of steel rails having the same hardness, in order to reliably improve fatigue strength of the steel rail. As shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the fatigue limit stress ranges of pearlite structure having the same hardness vary with ranges of about 200 to 250 MPa. Here, the starting point of a steel rail that was fractured during the fatigue test was examined. As a result, it was confirmed that the starting point has concavities and convexities, and fatigue damage occurs from the concavities and convexities.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">Here, the inventors examined a relationship between fatigue strength of the steel rail and concavities and convexities of the surface thereof in detail. The result is shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2. FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between the maximum surface roughness Rmax and the fatigue limit stress range by measuring roughness of the surface of a bottom portion of a steel rail having a C amount of 0.65 to 1.20%, a Si amount of 0.50%, a Mn amount of 0.80%, and a hardness of Hv320 to Hv500 using a roughness meter. Here, the maximum surface roughness is the sum of a depth of the maximum valley and a height of the maximum mountain with respect to an average value of depths or heights from the bottom portion to a head portion in the rail vertical direction (height direction) as a measurement reference length, and for details, indicates the maximum height (Rz) of a roughness curve described in JIS B 0601. In addition, when the surface roughness is measured, scale (oxide film) of the rail surface was removed by acid washing or sandblasting in advance.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The fatigue strength of steel is correlated with the maximum surface roughness Rmax, and in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, when the maximum surface roughness Rmax is less than or equal to 180 µm, the fatigue limit stress range is significantly increased. Accordingly, it was found that the minimum fatigue strength (≥300 MPa) needed for the rail is ensured. In addition, the rail having a hardness of Hv320 further increases in the fatigue limit stress range when its maximum surface roughness Rmax is less than or equal to 90 µm, the rail having a hardness of Hv400 further increases in the fatigue limit stress range when its maximum surface roughness Rmax is less than or equal to 120 µm, and the rail having a hardness of Hv500 further increases in the fatigue limit stress range when its maximum surface roughness Rmax is less than or equal to 150 µm.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">From the result, in order to improve the fatigue strength of the steel rail having high carbon component, it was newly found that the metallic structure has to be a single phase structure of pearlite, the surface hardness of the steel rail has to be confined in the range of Hv320 to Hv500, and the maximum surface roughness (Rmax) has to be confined to be less than or equal to 180 µm.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">Here, when a small amount of ferrite, martensite, and pro-eutectoid cementite is mixed with the pearlite structure, the fatigue strength is not reduced significantly. However, in order to improve the fatigue strength to the maximum degree, it is preferable that the pearlite structure have the single phase structure.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">Moreover, the inventors examined a relationship between fatigue limit stress range, surface hardness (SVH : Surface Vickers Hardness), and maximum surface roughness Rmax of the steel rail in detail. As a result, it was found that there is a correlation between a ratio of the surface hardness (SVH) of the steel rail to the maximum surface roughness Rmax, that is, SVH/Rmax and the fatigue limit stress range. <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between SVH/Rmax of the steel rail having a C amount of 0.65 to 1.20%, a Si amount of 0.50%, a Mn amount of 0.80%, and a hardness of Hv320 to Hv500 and the fatigue limit stress range thereof. It was newly known that with regard to the steel rails having any of the hardnesses Hv320, Hv400, and Hv500, the fatigue limit stress ranges of the steel rails having a value SVH/Rmax of more than or equal to 3.5 increases to 380 MPa or higher and thus the fatigue strength greatly increases.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">In addition to the embodiment, the inventors examined a correlation between the roughness of the surface and the fatigue strength of the steel rail in order to improve fatigue strength of the steel rail. <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> shows a result of the fatigue test of the steel rails having a C amount of 1.00%, a Si amount of 0.50%, a Mn amount of 0.80%, and a hardness of Hv400 when the maximum surface roughnesses Rmax thereof are 150 µm and 50 µm. In order to examine a relationship between the roughness of the surface of the bottom portion and the fatigue limit stress range in detail, a correlation between the number of concavities and convexities that exceeds 0.30 times the maximum surface roughness with respect to an average value of depths or heights in the rail vertical direction (height direction) from the bottom portion to the head portion and the fatigue limit stress range. In addition, the number of concavities and convexities is counted for a length of the bottom portion of 5 mm in the rail longitudinal direction. It was found that with regard to the steel rails having any hardness and maximum surface roughnesses Rmax of 150 µm and 50 µm, by using steel rails having the number of concavities and convexities of 40 or less, and preferably, 10 or less, the fatigue limit stress range further increases, and thus the fatigue strength greatly increases.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">That is, in this embodiment, by allowing the surface hardness SVH of the head portion and the bottom portion of the steel rail to be in the range of Hv320 to Hv500, and using the steel rail that has a pearlite structure with high carbon component and the maximum surface roughness Rmax of less than or equal to 180 µm, fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite-based rail used for freight railways overseas and the domestic passenger rails can be improved. In addition, by using the pearlite-based rail that has a pearlite structure with high carbon component in which a ratio SVH/Rmax of the surface hardness to the maximum surface roughness is higher than or equal to 3.5, or by using the pearlite-based rail that has a pearlite structure with high carbon component in which the number of concavities and convexities is less<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> than or equal to 40, it is possible to increase the fatigue limit stress range and to greatly increase the fatigue strength.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">In this embodiment, the results of the surface of the bottom portion of the pearlite-based rail are shown in <figref idref="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. The same results as those shown in <figref idref="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> can be obtained for the surface of the head portion of the pearlite-based rail.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">In addition, the C amount, the Si amount, and the Mn amount are not limited to the values described above, and the same results can be obtained as long as the C amount is in the range of 0.65 to 1.20%, the Si amount is in the range of 0.05 to 2.00%, and the Mn amount is in the range of 0.05 to 2.00%.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Moreover, parts having the pearlite structure, parts having a surface hardness SVH in the range of Hv320 to Hv500, and parts having the maximum surface roughness Rmax of less than or equal to 180 µm may be included at least part of the head portion and at least part of the bottom portion of the pearlite-based rail.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">In addition, the ratio of the surface hardness SVH to the maximum surface roughness Rmax may not necessarily be greater than or equal to 3.5, and the number of concavities and convexities may not necessarily be less than or equal to 40. However, by allowing the ratio SVH/Rmax to be greater than or equal to 3.5 and allowing the number of concavities and convexities to be less than or equal to 40, as described above, the improvement of the fatigue strength can be further achieved.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">Next, the reason of limitation in this embodiment will be described in detail. Hereinafter, in terms of steel composition, mass% is simply referred to as %.</p>
<heading id="h0010">(1) Reason of Limitation of Chemical Components</heading>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The reason of limitation of the chemical components of the pearlite-based rail so that the C amount is in the range of 0.65 to 1.20%, the Si amount of 0.05 to 2.00%, and the Mn amount is in the range of 0.05 to 2.00% will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">C accelerates pearlite transformation and thus ensures wear resistance. When the C amount in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.65%, pro-eutectoid ferrite which is harmful to fatigue properties of the pearlite structure is more likely to occur, and moreover, it becomes difficult to maintain the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure. As a result, the fatigue damage resistance of the rail is degraded. In addition, when the C amount in the pearlite rail exceeds 1.20%, a pro-eutectoid cementite structure which is harmful to the fatigue properties of the pearlite structure is more likely to occur. As a result, the fatigue damage resistance of the rail is degraded. Accordingly, the C amount in the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.65 to 1.20%.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">Si is an essential component as a deoxidizing agent. In addition, Si increases the harness (strength) of the pearlite structure due to solid solution strengthening of the ferrite phase in the pearlite structure, and thus improves the fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite structure. Moreover, Si suppresses a generation of a pro-eutectoid cementite structure in hypereutectoid steel and thus suppresses degradation of the fatigue properties. However, when the Si amount in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.05%, those effects cannot be sufficiently expected. In addition, when the Si amount in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 2.00%, hardenability significantly increases, and thus a martensite structure which is harmful to the fatigue properties is more likely to occur. Accordingly, the amount of Si added to the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.05 to 2.00%.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Mn increases hardenability and thus makes a lamellar spacing in the pearlite structure fine, thereby ensuring the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure and enhancing the fatigue damage resistance. However, when the amount of Mn contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.05%, those effects are small, and it becomes difficult to ensure the fatigue damage resistance that is needed for the rail. In addition, when the amount of Mn contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 2.00%, hardenability is significantly increased, and the martensite structure which is harmful to the fatigue properties is more likely to occur. Accordingly, the amount of Mn added to the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.05 to 2.00%.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">In addition, to the pearlite-based rail produced of the component composition described above, elements Cr, Mo, V, Nb, Co, B, Cu, Ni, Ti, Ca, Mg, Zr, Al, and N are added as needed for the purpose of enhancing the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure, that is, improving the fatigue damage resistance, improving wear resistance, improving toughness, preventing a welding heat-affected zone from softening, and controlling a cross-sectional hardness distribution of the inside of the head portion of the rail.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">Here, Cr and Mo increase the equilibrium transformation point of pearlite and mainly make the pearlite lamellar spacing fine thereby ensuring the hardness of the pearlite structure. V and Nb suppress growth of austenite grains by carbide and nitride generated during hot rolling and cooling thereafter. Moreover, V and Nb improve the toughness and hardness of the pearlite structure or the ferrite structure by precipitation hardening. In addition, V and Nb stably generate carbide and nitride during re-heating and thus prevent a heat-affected zone of the welding joint from softening. Co makes the lamellar structure or ferrite grain size of a rolling contact surface fine thereby increasing wear resistance of the pearlite structure. B reduces the cooling rate dependency of the pearlite transformation temperature thereby uniformizing the hardness distribution of the rail head portion. Cu solid-solubilized into ferrite in the pearlite structure or the pearlite<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> structure thereby increasing the hardness of the pearlite structure. Ni improves the toughness and hardness of the ferrite structure or the pearlite structure and simultaneously prevents heat-affected zone of the welding joint from softening. Ti refines the structure in weld heat-affected zones and prevents the embrittlement of welded joint heat-affected zones.. Ca and Mg make the austenite grains fine during rail rolling and simultaneously accelerate pearlite transformation thereby enhancing the toughness of the pearlite structure. Zr increases an equiaxial crystallization rate of a solidified structure and suppresses formation of a segregation zone of a center portion of a bloom thereby making the thickness of the pro-eutectoid cementite structure fine. Al moves a eutectoid transformation temperature to a higher temperature side and thus increases the hardness of the pearlite structure. The main purpose of adding N is to accelerate pearlite transformation as N segregates to austenite grain boundaries and make a pearlite block size fine, thereby enhancing the toughness.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">The reason of the limitation of the additive amounts of such components in the pearlite-based rail will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Cr increases the equilibrium transformation temperature and consequently makes the lamellar spacing of the pearlite structure fine, thereby contributing to the increase in the hardness (strength). Simultaneously, Cr strengthens a cementite phase and thus improves the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure, thereby enhancing the fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite structure. However, when the amount of Cr contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.01%, those effects are small, and the effect of enhancing the hardness of the pearlite-based rail cannot be completely exhibited. In addition, when the amount of Cr contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 2.00%, the hardenability is increased, and thus the martensite structure which is harmful to the fatigue properties of the pearlite structure is more likely to occur. As a result, the fatigue damage resistance of the rail is degraded. Accordingly, the amount of Cr added to the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.01 to 2.00%.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">Mo increases the equilibrium transformation temperature like Cr and consequently makes the lamellar spacing of the pearlite structure fine thereby contributing to the increase in the hardness (strength) and enhancing the fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite structure. However, when the amount of Mo contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.01%, those effects are small, and the effect of enhancing the hardness of the pearlite-based rail cannot be completely exhibited. In addition, when the amount of Mo contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 0.50%, the transformation rate is significantly reduced, and thus the martensite structure which is harmful to the fatigue properties of the pearlite structure is more likely to occur. As a result, the fatigue damage resistance of the rail is degraded. Accordingly, the amount of Mo added to the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.01 to 0.50%.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">V precipitates as V carbide or V nitride during typical hot rolling or a heat treatment performed at a high temperature and makes austenite grains fine due to a pinning effect. Accordingly, the toughness of the pearlite structure can be improved. Moreover, V increases the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure due to the precipitation hardening by the V carbide and V nitride generated during cooling after the hot rolling thereby enhancing the fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite structure. In addition, V generates V carbide and V nitride in a relatively high temperature range in a heat-affected zone that is re-heated in a temperature range of lower than or equal to Ac1 point, and thus is effective in preventing the heat-affected zone of the welding joint from softening. However, when the V amount is less than 0.005%, those effects cannot be sufficiently expected, and the improvement of the pearlite structure in the toughness and hardness (strength) is not admitted. In addition, when the V amount exceeds 0.50%, the precipitation hardening of the V carbide or V nitride excessively occurs, and thus the toughness of the pearlite structure is degraded, thereby degrading the toughness of the rail. Accordingly, the amount of V added to the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.005 to 0.50%.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">Nb, like V, makes austenite grains fine due to the pinning effect of Nb carbide or Nb nitride during the typical hot rolling or the heat treatment performed at a high temperature and thus improves the toughness of the pearlite structure. Thereby enhancing the fatigue damage resistance of the pearlite structure. In addition, Nb increases the hardness (strength) of the pearlite structure due to the precipitation hardening by the Nb carbide and Nb nitride generated during cooling after the hot rolling. In addition, Nb stably generates Nb carbide and Nb nitride from a low temperature range to a high temperature range in the heat-affected zone that is re-heated in the temperature range of lower than or equal to Ac1 point, and thus prevents the heat-affected zone of the welding joint from softening. However, when the amount of Nb contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.002%, those effects cannot be expected, and the improvement of the pearlite structure in the toughness and hardness (strength) is not admitted. In addition, when the Nb contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 0.050%, the precipitation hardening of the Nb carbide or Nb nitride excessively occurs, and thus the toughness of the pearlite structure is degraded, thereby degrading the toughness of the rail. Accordingly, the amount of Nb added to the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.002 to 0.050%.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">Co solid-solubilized into the ferrite phase in the pearlite structure and makes the fine ferrite structure formed by contact with wheels at the rolling contact surface of the rail head portion further fine thereby improving the wear resistance. When the amount of Co contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.01%, the fineness of the ferrite structure cannot be achieved, so that the effect of enhancing the wear resistance cannot be expected. In addition, when the amount of Co contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 1.00%, those effects are saturated, so that the fineness of the ferrite structure according to the additive amount cannot be achieved. In addition, economic efficiency is reduced<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> due to the increase in costs caused by adding alloys. Accordingly, the amount of Co added to the pearlite-based rail is limited to 0.01 to 1.00%.</p>

Accordingly, B gives a more uniform hardness distribution from the surface to the inside of the head portion to the rail, it becomes possible to increase the service life of the rail. However, when the amount of B contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.0001%, those effects are not sufficient, and the improvement of the hardness distribution of the rail head portion is not admitted. In addition, when the amount of B contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 0.0050%, coarse iron carbide boride is generated, resulting in a reduction in toughness.

In addition, when the amount of Cu contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 1.00%, due to a significant increase in hardenability, the martensite structure which is harmful to the fatigue properties of the pearlite structure is more likely to occur.

In addition, Ti is used that precipitated Ti carbide and Ti nitride do not dissolve during the re-heating at welding, Ti makes the structure of the heat-affected zone heated to an austenite range fine, thereby preventing embrittlement of the welding joint portion. However, when the amount of Ti contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.0050%, those effects are small. In addition, when the amount of Ti contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 0.0500%, coarse Ti carbide and Ti nitride are generated, and fatigue damage occur from the coarse precipitate.

As a result, by making the block size of pearlite fine, the toughness of the pearlite structure can be improved. However, when the amount of Mg contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.0005%, those effects are weak, and when the amount of Mg contained in the pearlite-based rail exceeds 0.0200%, coarse oxide of Mg is generated, and fatigue damage occurs from the coarse oxide.

However, when the amount of Zr contained in the pearlite-based rail is less than 0.0001 %, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> number of ZrO<sub>2</sub>-based inclusions is small, and Zr does not show a sufficient function as a solidification nucleus.

<p id="p0072" num="0072">The reason that the metallic structure of the surfaces of the head portion and the bottom portion of the pearlite-based rail is limited to the pearlite structure will be described.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">When the ferrite structure, the pro-eutectoid cementite structure, and the martensite structure are mixed with the pearlite structure, strain is concentrated on the ferrite structure having a relatively low hardness (strength), the generation of fatigue cracks is caused. In addition, in the pro-eutectoid cementite structure and the martensite structure having relatively low toughnesses, fine brittle breakage occurs, the generation of fatigue cracks is caused. Moreover, since the head portion of the pearlite-based rail needs to ensure wear resistance, it is preferable that the head portion have the pearlite structure. Accordingly, the metallic structure of at least part of the head portion and at least part of the bottom portion is limited to the pearlite structure.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">In addition, it is preferable that the metallic structure of the pearlite-based rail according to this embodiment have a single phase structure of pearlite in which the ferrite structure, the pro-eutectoid cementite structure, and the martensite structure are not mixed therewith.

Although such structures are mixed, the structures do not have a significantly adverse effect on the fatigue damage resistance or wear resistance of the rail head portion. Therefore, even through a small amount of the pro-eutectoid ferrite structure, the pro-eutectoid cementite structure, or the martensite structure of 3% or less is mixed with the pearlite-based rail, it is possible to provide a pearlite-based rail with excellent fatigue damage resistance.</p>

In addition, when the surface hardness SVH of the pearlite structure exceeds Hv500, the toughness of the pearlite structure is significantly reduced, and fine brittle breakage is more likely to occur.

When the volume ratio of nitrogen in the heating furnace is lower than 30%, the amount of primary scale generated inside the heating furnace is increased, and even when descaling is performed thereafter, the primary scale is insufficiently removed, resulting in an increase in surface roughness.

<heading id="h0020">(D) Detailed control of mechanical descaling, and descaling using high-pressure water or air</heading>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">In order to uniformly peel the scale of the surfaces of the head portion of the bottom portion of the rail and suppress surface concavities and convexities newly generated during the descaling so as to cause the number of concavities and convexities that exceed 0.30 times the maximum surface roughness to be a predetermined number or smaller, it is preferable that the descaling be performed under the following conditions.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">In the case of the mechanical descaling, measures to suppress the projection speed from being excessive and make dimensions (diameter or length) of the steel ball which is a shot material, polygonal fragments (grid) made of iron, and polygonal fragments (grid) including alumina and silicon carbide fine are needed.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">In addition, in the case of injecting of high-pressure water or air, measures to suppress the injection pressure from being excessive and make injection holes for determining the dimensions of the spraying material fine.</p>
<p id="p0118" num="0118">In addition, with regard to the fluctuation of nozzles for the injection, it is preferable that periodical nozzle fluctuation be performed in response to the movement speed of the biller or the rail. Although the fluctuation speed is<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> not limited, it is preferable that the fluctuation speed be controlled so that the spraying material are sprayed uniformly on portions corresponding to the surfaces of the head portion and the bottom portion of the rail.</p>
<heading id="h0021">(E) Descaling Temperature Range</heading>
<p id="p0119" num="0119">It is preferable that a descaling temperature range immediately after the re-heating extraction of the bloom for the rail and during the rough hot rolling be 1,250 to 1,050 °C. Since the descaling is performed immediately after re-heating (1,250 to 1,300 °C) extraction of the bloom, the upper limit of the descaling temperature is practically 1,250 °C. In addition, when the descaling temperature becomes less than or equal to 1,050 °C, the primary scaling is strengthened and thus cannot be easily removed. Accordingly, it is preferable that the descaling temperature range be 1,250 to 1,050 °C.</p>
<p id="p0120" num="0120">It is preferable that the descaling temperature range during rail finish hot rolling be 1,050 to 950 °C. Secondary scaling is generated at 1,050 °C or less, the upper limit thereof is practically 1,050 °C. In addition, when the descaling temperature becomes less than or equal to 950 °C, the temperature of the rail is likely to be reduced, so that the heat treatment starting temperature during a heat treatment described in Patent Documents 3 and 4 cannot be ensured. Accordingly, the hardness of the rail is reduced, resulting in a significant reduction in the fatigue damage resistance. Therefore, it is preferable that the descaling temperature range be 1,050 to 950 °C.</p>
<heading id="h0022">(F) Number of descaling</heading>
<p id="p0121" num="0121">In order to sufficiently remove the primary scale immediately after the extraction of the re-heated bloom and during rough hot rolling, it is preferable that descaling be performed 4 to 12 times immediately before hot rolling. When the descaling is performed less than four times, the primary scale cannot be sufficiently removed, concavities and convexities occur on the rail surface by pushing into the material side of the scale, the surface roughness is increased. That is, it is difficult for the maximum surface roughness Rmax of the rail surface to be less than or equal to 180µm. On the other hand, when the descaling is performed more than 12 times, the roughness of the rail surface is reduced. However, the temperature of the rail itself is reduced, and the heat treatment starting temperature during the heat treatment described in Patent Documents 3 and 4 cannot be ensured. As a result, the hardness of the rail is reduced, and the fatigue damage resistance is significantly reduced. Accordingly, it is preferable that the descaling be performed 4 to 12 times immediately after the extraction of the re-heated bloom and the rough hot rolling.</p>
<p id="p0122" num="0122">In order to sufficiently remove the secondary scale during finish hot rolling, it is preferable that the descaling be performed 3 to 8 times immediately before the hot rolling. When the descaling is performed less than 3 times, the secondary scale cannot be sufficiently removed, and concavities and convexities occurs as the scale is pushed into the material, resulting in an increase in the roughness of the surface. On the other hand, when the descaling is performed more than 8 times, the roughness of the rail surface is reduced. However, the temperature of the rail itself is reduced, and the heat treatment starting temperature during the heat treatment described in Patent Documents 3 and 4 cannot be ensured. As a result, the hardness of the rail is reduced, the fatigue damage resistance is significantly reduced. Accordingly, it is preferable that the descaling be performed 3 to 8 times during the finish hot rolling.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">In order to cause the ratio of the surface hardness SVH to the maximum surface roughness Rmax of the pearlite-based rail to be higher than or equal to 3.5 for further enhancing the fatigue damage resistance, it is preferable that the descaling be performed 8 to 12 times at a rough hot rolling temperature of 1,200 to 1,050 °C or 5 to 8 times at a finish hot rolling temperature of 1,050 to 950 °C.</p>
<p id="p0124" num="0124">With regard to portions on which the descaling is to be performed, it is preferable that the descaling be performed at corresponding positions on the surfaces of the head portion and the bottom portion of the rail in the bloom for the rail rolling. With regard to other portions, the improvement in the fatigue damage resistance cannot be expected even though active descaling is performed, and the rail is excessively cooled, as a result, there is a concern that the material of the rail may be deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p0125" num="0125">In Tables 3-1 and 3-2, relationships between the atmosphere control of the heating furnace during hot rolling, mechanical descaling, conditions of the descaling during rough hot rolling immediately after the extraction of the re-heated bloom and during descaling finish hot rolling, control of mechanical descaling using high-pressure water or air, heat treatment starting temperature, and heat treatment and characteristics of steel rails (the pearlite-based rails) A8 and A17 are shown.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">By performing the atmosphere control, the mechanical descaling, and the descaling using high-pressure water or air under certain conditions, and by performing appropriate heat treatments as needed, the hardness (SVH) of the surfaces of the head portion and the bottom portion of the rail can be ensured, and moreover, the maximum surface roughness (Rmax) is reduced, and the number of concavities and convexities that exceed 0.30 times the maximum surface roughness can be less than or equal to a predetermined number. Accordingly, since the ratio of the surface hardness (SVH) to the maximum surface roughness Rmax can be increased, and the number of concavities and convexities can be reduced to be less than or equal to 40, and preferably, be less than or equal to 10, the fatigue damage<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> resistance of the rail can be significantly improved.</p>
