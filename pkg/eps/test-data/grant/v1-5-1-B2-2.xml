<heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to the use of a nucleic acid sequence for the treatment of a p53 negative cancer.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) have emerged as an important novel class of regulatory RNA, which has profound impact on a wide array of biological processes. These small (typically 18-24 nucleotides long) non-coding RNA molecules can modulate protein expression patterns by promoting RNA degradation, inhibiting mRNA translation, and also affecting gene transcription. MiRs play pivotal roles in diverse processes such as development and differentiation, control of cell proliferation, stress response and metabolism. There are currently about 700 known human miRs, and their number probably exceeds 800.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The expression of many miRs was found to be altered in numerous types of human cancer, and in some cases strong evidence has been put forward in support of the conjecture that such alterations may play a causative role in tumor progression. Cancer-associated changes in miR expression patterns can be brought about by various genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Most notably, a number of transcription factors whose activity is altered in cancer cells, including c-myc and E2F, were found to regulate the RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of the precursors of particular miRs. Hence, the oncogenic effects of these transcription factors may be mediated not only by modulation of protein-coding mRNA levels but also by specific changes in miR expression.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The p53 protein is a sequence-specific transcription factor that functions as a major tumor suppressor in mammals. p53 is activated in response to a variety of stress signals, including genotoxic damage, dysfunction of the mitotic apparatus, aberrant activation of oncogenes, oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation and more. The activated p53 can dictate a plethora of biochemical and biological outcomes, ranging from effective repair of minor damage all the way to cessation of cell cycle progression and induction of replicative senescence and apoptotic cell death. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor function of p53 is one of the most frequent genetic alterations in human cancer, and close to half of all human tumors carry p53 gene mutations within their cells.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">As a transcription factor, p53 can increase or repress the transcription of many hundreds of protein-encoding genes, and this ability is believed to underlie in great part its tumor suppressor functions.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">To date there has been no definitive description of any miR whose expression is directly regulated by p53, or of the functional consequences of such regulation.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the important role of cell death in developmental processes, in normal function and in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases and conditions, there is an increasing need for novel methods of modulating cell death in cell populations and for compositions that may be effectively employed in such methods.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention provides the use of a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) SEQ ID NO: 1; and (b) a sequence at least about 80% identical to (a), for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer, wherein the cancer is p53 negative, and is selected from the group consisting of Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, osteosarcoma, renal carcinoma, colon carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, hepatoma, glioblastoma and melanoma.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present invention, the composition may be administered in combination with an anticancer agent, radiotherapy, or combinations thereof. Preferably, the composition may be administered in combination with at least one other anticancer agent. More preferably, the anticancer agent may be selected from the group consisting of cisplatin, carboplatin, camptothecins, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, vinblastine, Actinomycin D and cloposide.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention provides further provides a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) SEQ ID NO: 1; and (b) a sequence at least about 80% identical to (a), for use in the treatment of cancer, wherein the cancer is p53 negative, and is selected from the group consisting of Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, osteosarcoma, renal carcinoma, colon carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, hepatoma, glioblastoma and melanoma.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The expression of several miRs (SEQ ID NOS: 1-9) was altered by p53 activation. It is demonstrated that the gene encoding the pri-miR-34a (SEQ ID NO: 10) is a direct transcriptional target of p53. Positive regulation of transcription by p53 is mediated via a strong p53 binding site (p53BS) (SEQ ID NO: 11), located within the transcribed region of the pri-miR-34a gene.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention discloses the finding that miR-34a (SEQ ID NO: 1) possess antiproliferative and proapoptotic<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> activities, thereby contributing to the tumor suppressor effects of activated p53.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">These and other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent in conjunction with the figures, description and claims that follow.</p>

<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li><figref idref="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows miR expression profiling of H1299-TS using miRdicator<sup>™</sup> array. 15µg of total RNA extracted from H1299-TS cell lines cultured at the permissive (32°C) or restrictive (37°C) temperatures were ligated to Cy3 and hydridized overnight on two miRdicator<sup>™</sup> arrays. Data is presented in arbitrary fluorescence units (fl.u.). Crosses represent signals for all human miRs; magenta squares represent background and non-specific probes. Circles represent signals of synthetic spike-in controls, and diamonds indicate human miRs which showed notable differential expression. Each miR-probe was spotted in triplicate and each data point in the figure represents at least 2 spots that fall within ±14% of the value indicated (or ±100 fl.u. for low signals), and none being further off than ±73% of this value (or ±300 fl.u. for low signals). As an additional control and validation, subsets of 10 miRs were measured by several different probe designs, which hybridize with different affinity. miR-34a showed a high expression level in the presence of active p53 and significant differential expression of above 10 fold in comparison to the non permissive temperature. Three different probe designs for miR-199a produced different absolute signal values, yet all three showed the same degree of differential expression between the two samples.</li>
<li><figref idref="f0002 f0003 f0004">Figure 2</figref> shows the induction of the expression of miR-34a by wt p53. (A) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of miR-34a expression in H1299 and H1299-TS cells cultured at the permissive (32°C) or restrictive (37°C) temperatures. Cells were cultured at 37°C and then shifted to 32°C for the indicated periods. RNA was isolated and 10ng RNA was subjected to qRT-PCR to determine the levels of miR-34a and U6 RNA. The bars represent relative miR-34a expression, normalized to U6 in the same samples. RU - relative units.
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact">
<li>(B) H1299 and H1299-TS cells were cultured continuously at 37°C or transferred to 32°C for 3 days. RNA was extracted, and 20µg RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis with an anti-miR34a LNA probe labeled with <sup>32</sup>P (lower panel). Positions of size markers are shown on the right; numbers denote length in nucleotides. Small RNAs stained with ethidium bromide are shown as a loading control (upper panel).</li>

<heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the present invention, p53 can induce the expression of miR-34a (SEQ ID NO: 1), by binding to a perfect p53 binding site located within the gene that gives rise to miR-34a. Overexpression of miR-34a exerts anti-proliferative effects and promotes cell death, whereas inactivation of miR-34a attenuates p53-mediated cell death. Hence, miR-34a is a direct transcriptional target of p53, which may mediate some of the biological effects of this tumor suppressor. Perturbation of miR-34a expression may thus contribute to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Expression of miR-34a is augmented by p53 in response to pertinent stress signals, as demonstrated here for the anti-cancer drug 5-FU. Furthermore, excessive levels of miR-34a exert inhibitory antiproliferative effects and promote cell death, whereas endogenous miR-34a can contribute to p53-dependent cell death.</p>

<heading id="h0017"><b>cell death</b></heading>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">"Cell death" as used herein refers to cell-death by an accidental (necrosis) manner, which is a form of cell-death that results from acute tissue injury and provokes an inflammatory response, cell-death by a programmed pathway (programmed cell-death) or cell-death by autophagy.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">"Programmed cell-death (PCD)" as used herein means death of a cell in any form, mediated by an intracellular program. PCD is carried out in a regulated process which generally confers advantage during an organism's life-cycle. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and metazoa (multicellular animals) tissue development. Three types of PCD are characterized: (i) Apoptosis or Type I cell-death; (ii) Autophagic or Type II cell-death; (iii) "non-apoptotic programmed cell-death" (or "caspase-independent programmed cell-death" or "necrosis-like programmed cell-death") which is an alternative route to death are as efficient as apoptosis and can function as either backup mechanisms or the main type of PCD.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">"Necrosis" as used herein means accidental death of cells and living tissue. Necrosis is less orderly than apoptosis. The disorderly death generally does not send cell signals which tell nearby phagocytes to engulf the dying cell. This lack of signaling makes it harder for the immune system to locate and recycle dead cells which have died through necrosis than if the cell had undergone cell death. The release of intracellular content after cellular membrane damage is the cause of inflammation in necrosis.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">"Autophagy" as used herein means a catabolic process involving the degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal machinery. It is a tightly regulated process which plays a normal part in cell growth, development, and homeostasis, where it helps maintain a balance between the synthesis, degradation, and subsequent recycling of cellular products. It is a major mechanism by which a starving cell reallocates nutrients from unnecessary processes to more essential processes. A variety of autophagic processes exist, all sharing in common the degradation of intracellular components via the lysosome. The most well known mechanism of autophagy involves the formation of a membrane around a targeted region of the cell, separating the contents from the rest of the cytoplasm. The resultant vesicle then fuses with a lysosome and subsequently degrades the contents.</p>

Drosha may cleave the pri-miRNA with a staggered cut typical of RNase III endonucleases yielding a pre-miRNA stem loop with a 5' phosphate and ~2 nucleotide 3' overhang. Approximately one helical turn of stem (∼10 nucleotides) extending beyond the Drosha cleavage site may be essential for efficient processing. The pre-miRNA may then be actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by Ran-GTP and the export receptor Ex-portin-5.</p>
<p id="p0081" num="0081">The pre-miRNA may be recognized by Dicer, which is also an RNase III endonuclease. Dicer may recognize the double-stranded stem of the pre-miRNA. Dicer may also recognize the 5' phosphate and 3' overhang at the base of the stem loop. Dicer may cleave off the terminal loop two helical turns away from the base of the stem loop leaving an additional 5' phosphate and ~2 nucleotide 3' overhang. The resulting siRNA-like duplex, which may comprise mismatches, comprises the mature miRNA and a similar-sized fragment known as the miRNA*. The miRNA and miRNA* may be derived from opposing arms of the pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA. MiRNA* sequences may be found in libraries of cloned miRNAs but typically at lower frequency than the miRNAs.</p>
<p id="p0082" num="0082">Although initially present as a double-stranded species with miRNA*, the miRNA may eventually become incorporated as a single-stranded RNA into a ribonucleoprotein complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Various proteins can form the RISC, which can lead to variability in specifity for miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, binding site of the target gene, activity of miRNA (repress or activate), and which strand of the miRNA/miRNA* duplex is loaded in to the RISC.</p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">When the miRNA strand of the miRNA:miRNA* duplex is loaded into the RISC, the miRNA* may be removed and degraded. The strand of the miRNA:miRNA* duplex that is loaded into the RISC may be the strand whose 5' end is less tightly paired. In cases where both ends of the miRNA:miRNA* have roughly equivalent 5' pairing, both miRNA and miRNA* may have gene silencing activity.</p>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">The RISC may identify target nucleic acids based on high levels of complementarity between the miRNA and the mRNA, especially by nucleotides 2-8 of the miRNA. Only one case has been reported in animals where the interaction between the miRNA and its target was along the entire length of the miRNA. This was shown for mir-196 and Hox B8 and it was further shown that mir-196 mediates the cleavage of the Hox B8 mRNA (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Yekta et al 2004, Science 304-594</text></nplcit>). Otherwise, such interactions are known only in plants (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Bartel &amp; Bartel 2003, Plant Physiol 132-709</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">A number of studies have looked at the base-pairing requirement between miRNA and its mRNA target for achieving efficient inhibition of translation (reviewed by <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Bartel 2004, Cell 116-281</text></nplcit>). In mammalian cells, the first 8 nucleotides of the miRNA may be important (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Doench &amp; Sharp 2004 GenesDev 2004-504</text></nplcit>). However, other parts of the microRNA may also participate in mRNA binding. Moreover, sufficient base pairing at the 3' can compensate for insufficient pairing at the 5' (<nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Brennecke et al, 2005 PLoS 3-e85</text></nplcit>). Computation studies, analyzing miRNA binding on whole genomes have suggested a specific role for bases 2-7 at the 5' of the miRNA in target binding but the role of the first nucleotide, found usually to be "A" was also recognized (<nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Lewis et at 2005 Cell 120-15</text></nplcit>). Similarly, nucleotides 1-7 or 2-8 were used to identify and validate targets by <nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>Krek et al (2005, Nat Genet 37-495</text></nplcit>).</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">The target sites in the mRNA may be in the 5' UTR, the 3' UTR or in the coding region. Interestingly, multiple miRNAs may regulate the same mRNA target by recognizing the same or multiple sites. The presence of multiple miRNA binding sites in most genetically identified targets may indicate that the cooperative action of multiple RISCs provides the most efficient translational inhibition.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">MiRNAs may direct the RISC to downregulate gene expression by either of two mechanisms: mRNA cleavage or translational repression. The miRNA may specify cleavage of the mRNA if the mRNA has a certain degree of complementarity<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> to the miRNA. When a miRNA guides cleavage, the cut may be between the nucleotides pairing to residues 10 and 11 of the miRNA. Alternatively, the miRNA may repress translation if the miRNA does not have the requisite degree of complementarity to the miRNA. Translational repression may be more prevalent in animals since animals may have a lower degree of complementarity between the miRNA and binding site.</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">It should be noted that there may be variability in the 5' and 3' ends of any pair of miRNA and miRNA*. This variability may be due to variability in the enzymatic processing of Drosha and Dicer with respect to the site of cleavage. Variability at the 5' and 3' ends of miRNA and miRNA* may also be due to mismatches in the stem structures of the pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA. The mismatches of the stem strands may lead to a population of different hairpin structures. Variability in the stem structures may also lead to variability in the products of cleavage by Drosha and Dicer.</p>

For example, in certain instances, a prodrug may be more bioavailable (e.g., through oral administration) than is the corresponding active form. In certain instances, a prodrug may have improved solubility compared to the corresponding active form. In certain embodiments, prodrugs are less water soluble than the corresponding active form. In certain instances, such prodrugs possess superior transmittal across cell membranes, where water solubility is detrimental to mobility. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is an ester. In certain such embodiments, the ester is metabolically hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid upon administration. In certain instances the carboxylic acid containing compound is the corresponding active form. In certain embodiments, a prodrug comprises a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bound to an acid group.

Each probe carries up to 22-nt linker at the 3' end of the miRNA's complement sequence in addition to an amine group used to couple the probes to coated glass slides. 20µM of each probe were dissolved in 2X SSC + 0.0035% SDS and spotted in triplicate on Schott Nexterion<sup>®</sup> Slide E coated microarray slides using a Genomic Solutions<sup>®</sup> BioRobotics MicroGrid II according the MicroGrid manufacturer's directions. 64 negative control probes were designed using the sense sequences of different miRNAs. Two groups of positive control probes were designed to hybridize to miRdicator<sup>™</sup> array (1) synthetic spikes small RNA were added to the RNA before labeling to verify the labeling efficiency and (2) probes for abundant small RNA (e.g. small nuclear RNAs (U43, U49, U24, Z30, U6, U48, U44), 5.8s and 5s ribosomal RNA) are spotted on the array to verify RNA quality. The slides were blocked in a solution containing 50 mM ethanolamine, 1M Tris (pH 9.0) and 0.1%SDS for 20 min at 500C, then thoroughly rinsed with water and spun dry.</p>

<heading id="h0086"><b>p53-dependent differential expression of microRNAs</b></heading>
<p id="p0173" num="0173">To determine whether p53 can regulate the expression of specific microRNAs, we employed a clone of p53-null H1299 lung cancer cells stably transfected with an expression plasmid for the temperature sensitive p53 mutant p53Va1135 (H1299-TS). The p53Va1135 protein assumes wild type (wt) p53 conformation when the cells are shifted to the permissive temperature of 32°C (Michalovitz, 1990), resulting in activation of wt p53 biochemical and biological functions. As seen in <figref idref="f0019">Fig. 7A</figref>,<figref idref="f0020">C</figref>, such shift indeed led to induction of classical transcriptional targets of p53, such as p21 and Mdm2, at both protein and RNA levels. The effect was p53-specific, as it was not observed in parental H1299 cells upon a similar shift. RNA was prepared from both H1299 and H1299-TS cell lines, grown at either 32°C or 37°C. The four RNA samples were hybridized on two miRdicator<sup>™</sup> arrays as described (experimental procedures). Probes were designed for about 700 human miRs including all miRs registered in Sanger database version 9.0. H1299-TS cells expressing active p53 at the permissive temperature of 32°C exhibited markedly higher expression levels of several miRs, most prominent among them being miR-34a (SEQ ID NO: 1) which was upregulated more than 10-fold following p53 activation (<figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). miRs 638 (SEQ ID NO: 2), 373* (SEQ ID NO: 3), 492 (SEQ ID NO: 4), 126 (SEQ ID NO: 5), 140 (SEQ ID NO: 6), 491 (SEQ ID NO: 7) and 296 (SEQ ID NO: 8) were also noticeably up-regulated in the presence of activated p53. Slightly higher expression of background and nonspecific probes compared to the non-permissive temperature was also observed (<figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, squares); this may be due to adverse secondary effects of extended p53 activation. No significant difference in expression of specific miRs was found in the parental H1299 cells when shifted from 37°C to 32°C (<figref idref="f0021">Fig. 8A</figref>). miR-199a (SEQ ID NO: 9) was significantly upregulated in H1299-TS compared to H1299 cultured in<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> 37°C (<figref idref="f0022">Fig. 8B</figref>), and was downregulated in H1299-TS in the presence of active p53 compared to the non-permissive temperature (<figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h0087"><b>Example 3</b></heading>
<heading id="h0088"><b>miR-34a is activated by p53</b></heading>
<p id="p0174" num="0174">The results of the miRdicator<sup>™</sup> array were further validated by quantitative methods. miR-199a (SEQ ID NO: 9) levels were indeed reduced several fold when H1299-TS cells were shifted to 32°C (<figref idref="f0019">Fig. 7B</figref>). However, comparison with the p53-null parental H1299 cells suggested that this was due to a strong induction of miR-1 99a expression by the p53Va1135 protein at the non-permissive temperature of 37°C, which was attenuated at 32°C. This is consistent with a possible gain-of-function effect of mutant p53, which deserves further investigation.</p>
<p id="p0175" num="0175">miR-34a levels were found to increase dramatically in a p53-dependent manner, as measured by miRdicator<sup>™</sup> array (<figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), Real-Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR; <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>) and Northern blot analysis (<figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2B</figref>). The kinetics of miR-34a induction following p53 activation at 32°C (<figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>) were slower than those of p21 mRNA (<figref idref="f0020">Fig. 7C</figref>). Similar results were obtained with another independently established H1299-TS cell clone (data not shown). To further rule out clonal variation effects, H1299 cells were transiently transfected with wtp53. While basal miR-34a levels were almost undetectable, exogenous p53 overexpression led to a 20 fold increase in endogenous miR-34a (<figref idref="f0003">Fig. 2C</figref>, white bar), which was even higher than the induction of p21 mRNA in the same experiment (<figref idref="f0020">Fig. 7D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0176" num="0176">We next asked whether miR-34a can also be induced by physiological levels of p53. As seen in <figref idref="f0002 f0003 f0004">Fig. 2</figref>, stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of basal endogenous wtp53 (sip53) resulted in a moderate downregulation of miR-34a in HCT116 (panel D) and U2OS (panel E) cells. The impact of p53 on miR-34a expression became more pronounced when the endogenous wtp53 was further activated by treatment of HCT116 cells with 5 fluorouracil (5-FU; <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 2D</figref>), or treatment of U2OS cells with Nutlin-3 (Tovar, 2006), which interferes with the binding of p53 to its negative regulator Mdm2 (<figref idref="f0004">Fig. 2E</figref>); the effects of both drugs on the levels of p53, p21 and Mdm2 proteins are shown in Fig. 8C,D. The induction of miR-34a by those drugs was comparable to that of p21 mRNA (<figref idref="f0021">Fig. 8A</figref>,<figref idref="f0022">B</figref>). Altogether, these observations strongly argue that p53 is a positive regulator of miR-34a expression.</p>
<heading id="h0089"><b>Example 4</b></heading>
<heading id="h0090"><b>miR-34a is produced by splicing of a long p53-regulated primary transcript</b></heading>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">The pri-miR-34a (SEQ ID NO: 10) is located on the negative strand of human chromosome 1 (<figref idref="f0005">Fig. 3A</figref>, upper left end). We performed a search for putative p53 binding sites (p53BS) within the genomic region comprising miR-34a, using the p53MH algorithm (Hoh, 2002). The only site with a very high score (25.85, 100% of maximal score; indicated in bold letters in <figref idref="f0006">Fig. 3B</figref>) was found approximately 30Kb upstream to the mature miR-34a (asterisk in <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 3A</figref>). This site is located within a CpG island and in very close proximity to the 5' end of a recently reported EST (accession number DB286351; triangle in <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 3A</figref>). Moreover, this genomic region contains a validated p53 binding site (p53BS), identified by ChIP-PET (Wei, 2006). The reported EST sequence consists of two exons, separated by an intron of about 30Kb, with the miR-34a precursor located in the second exon (<figref idref="f0005">Fig. 3A</figref>,<figref idref="f0006">B</figref>); hereafter, we will refer to it as pm34a-EST (pri-miR-34 EST). As this EST was reported only once, we wished to confirm its existence in H1299-TS cells. To that end semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed on cDNA synthesized on RNA extracted from H1299-TS cells maintained at 32°C. The positions of the various PCR primers, relative to the two exons and the mature miR-34a, are indicated in <figref idref="f0006">Fig. 3B</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="f0007">Fig. 3C</figref>, products of lengths predicted from the EST sequence were indeed obtained. Notably, a DNA product of the correct length was obtained even with a reverse primer located 30 nucleotides downstream to the 3' end of the published EST (<figref idref="f0007">Fig. 3C</figref>, lanes 2,4,6), indicating that the RNA extends beyond that point.</p>
<p id="p0178" num="0178">These results demonstrated that the primary transcript of the miR-34a gene undergoes splicing to excise a 30Kb intron, presumably before being processed into the mature miR. To find out whether transcription of pm34a-EST is also positively regulated by p53, qRT-PCR was performed on RNA of H1299-TS cells, employing primers designed to detect the spliced RNA (see <figref idref="f0006">Fig. 3B</figref>,<figref idref="f0009">F</figref> for primer locations). As seen in <figref idref="f0008">Fig. 3D</figref>, p53 activation at 32oC resulted in production of abundant amounts of such RNA. Furthermore, abrogation of endogenous wt p53 downmodulated the amounts of the spliced RNA in several different cell lines (<figref idref="f0008">Fig. 3E</figref>). These data imply that p53 induces the transcription of a large mRNA, which is subsequently spliced and further processed into mature miR-34a (<figref idref="f0009">Fig. 3F</figref>). It should be noted that the data does not rule out the possible existence of additional exons in the primary transcript; in fact, several ESTs have been reported that suggest splicing of the present exon 1 to one or two additional upstream exons (data not shown).<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p>
<heading id="h0091"><b>Example 5</b></heading>
<heading id="h0092"><b>Expression of pm34a-EST and of miR-34a is directly stimulated by p53</b></heading>
<p id="p0179" num="0179">The relatively slow accumulation of miR-34a upon p53 induction might suggest that this is a secondary consequence of p53 activation, rather than a direct transcriptional effect. To distinguish between these possibilities, induction of pm34a-EST and miR-34a was assessed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). CHX did not prevent the induction of either pm34a-EST (<figref idref="f0010">Fig. 4A</figref>) or mature miR-34a (<figref idref="f0010">Fig. 4B</figref> and <figref idref="f0023">Fig. 9</figref>) in H1299-TS cells shifted to 32°C, nor did it affect p21 mRNA induction (panel C). Neither of the treatments affected control GAPDH mRNA levels (panel D). Hence, upregulation of pm34a-EST and mature miR-34a by p53 does not require <i>de novo</i> protein synthesis, implying that p53 is a direct transcriptional activator of the corresponding gene.</p>
<p id="p0180" num="0180">As discussed above, the first exon of pm34a-EST encompasses a perfect p53BS. To determine whether p53 can indeed bind to this site, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed on HCT116 cells where endogenous p53 had been knocked down by stable expression of p53 shRNA (sip53); cells transfected with LacZ shRNA (siLacZ), harboring unperturbed levels of wtp53, served as a control. Cells were assayed without or with further induction of p53 by 5-FU. The impact of p53 knockdown on the levels of p53, p21 and Mdm2 proteins is shown in <figref idref="f0022">Fig. 8B</figref>. As expected, immunoprecipitation of chromatin with antibodies against p53, but not control HA antibodies, was strongly enriched for the 5' p53BS of the p21 gene (<figref idref="f0012">Fig. 5A</figref>). Importantly, a comparable enrichment was found for the predicted p53BS residing within the pm34a-EST, but not for the GAPDH gene serving as a negative control. Hence, p53 binds directly to the pm34a-EST p53BS, and this binding is further augmented upon p53 activation by 5-FU.</p>
<p id="p0181" num="0181">Next, we wished to evaluate the ability of this p53BS to confer p53-dependent transcriptional activation. A region of genomic DNA, comprising the p53BS along with 1.5Kb of upstream sequences and 0.5Kb of downstream sequences (<figref idref="f0013">Fig. 5B</figref>), was cloned in front of the firefly luciferase gene in plasmid pGL3-basic; this is promoterless vector, and promoter activity has to be provided by the cloned DNA fragment. The resultant construct (EST-Prom-luc) was transfected into H1299 cells along with increasing amounts of a wtp53 plasmid. As seen in <figref idref="f0014">Fig. 5C</figref>, p53 strongly stimulated the activity of EST-Prom-luc (about 20 fold above the control pGL3-basic vector). The extent of stimulation was almost as high as that of a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying 17 tandem repeats of a synthetic p53BS (<figref idref="f0014">Fig. 5D</figref>, RGC).</p>
<p id="p0182" num="0182">To assess the impact of endogenous wtp53 on the transcriptional activity of EST-Prom, this reporter plasmid was transfected into HCT116 cells together with synthetic siRNA oligonucleotides specific for p53 (sip53) or LacZ (siLacZ) as a control. The resultant partial depletion of p53 protein is documented in <figref idref="f0024">Fig. 10</figref>. Knockdown of p53 caused a better than 3-fold decrease in luciferase expression from EST-Prom-luc (<figref idref="f0014">Fig. 5D</figref>). 5-FU caused a further mild activation of p53, which led to a nearly twofold increase in luciferase activity in the control (siLacZ) but not the p53-depleted (sip53) cells. Thus, the p53BS located in the first exon of pm34a-EST can bind p53 in vivo and drive p53-dependent transcriptional activation.</p>

<heading id="h0094"><b>miR-34a exerts antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects</b></heading>
<p id="p0183" num="0183">To explore the biological effects of miR-34a, the pm34a-EST sequence was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, giving rise to plasmid pcDNA3-pm34a-EST. Transient transfection of this plasmid into H1299 cells gave rise to substantial production of mature miR-34a, detected by Northern blotting (<figref idref="f0015">Fig. 6A</figref>) and by qRT-PCR (<figref idref="f0015">Fig. 6B</figref>, black bar, miR-34a). pcDNA3-pm34a-EST was transfected into H1299 cells together with a plasmid encoding puromycin resistance, and drug resistant colonies were scored 2 weeks later. Overexpression of pcDNA3-pm34a-EST caused a significant reduction in colony number (EST, <figref idref="f0016">Fig. 6C and 6D</figref>, representing two independent experiments) relative to the vector control (Cont). Furthermore, although overexpression of wtp53 inhibited colony formation more robustly, addition of pcDNA3-pm34a-EST slightly enhanced this inhibitory effect (EST+p53, <figref idref="f0016">Fig. 6C and 6D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p0184" num="0184">In addition to the miR-34a precursor, the pm34a-EST sequence also contains an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a hypothetical protein of 133 amino acid residues (<figref idref="f0025">Fig. 11</figref>). It could thus be argued that this putative protein, rather than miR-34a, was responsible for the observed suppression of colony formation. To address this possibility, mutations were introduced into pcDNA3-pm34a-EST such that the predicted ORF would be preserved; but the secondary structure of the miR-34a precursor would be disturbed in a manner that should prevent its processing into mature miR-34a and change the seed sequence of the miR (mutation positions are underlined in <figref idref="f0025">Fig. 11</figref>). The resultant plasmid, designated pcDNA3-pm34a-EST-MUT, was indeed incapable of giving rise to mature miR-34a (<figref idref="f0015">Fig. 6B</figref>, MUT), despite being transcribed at least as efficiently as its non-mutant counterpart (<figref idref="f0015">Fig. 6B</figref>, EST RNA, compare MUT to EST). Importantly, when transfected either alone or together with wtp53, the wt EST suppressed colony formation more efficiently than its mutant counterpart (<figref idref="f0017">Fig. 6E</figref>), supporting the conclusion that the mature miR-34a was responsible for at least part of the observed inhibitory effect. Together, these results imply that overexpression of miR-34a can exert<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> antiproliferative effects, as measured by long term clonogenic assays. p53 has well-documented proapoptotic activities. To investigate whether induction of miR-34a might contribute to such activities, we employed a locked nucleic acids (LNA) oligonucleotide complementary to the miR-34a sequence in order to block endogenous miR-34a function in U2OS cells; a corresponding scrambled oligonucleotides (Cont) was used as a control. As seen in <figref idref="f0017">Fig. 6F</figref>, inhibition of miR-34a (anti-miR 34a) led to a decrease in spontaneous apoptosis, presumably due to transfection-induced stress; this was evident microscopically (left panels), as well as by FACS-based detection of cells with sub-G1 DNA content, indicative of apoptosis (right panels). Furthermore, inhibition of miR-34a provided partial protection from the enhanced apoptosis due to treatment with the p53-activating drug Nutlin-3. This effect was p53-dependent, as it was not observed in U2OS cells in which the endogenous wtp53 had been knocked down by stable expression of p53 shRNA (sip53). Together, these data indicate that miR-34a can exert an antiproliferative effect and that at least part of that effect may rely on a proapoptotic activity of this miR.</p>

<heading id="h0096"><b>miR-34a regulates Notch pathway activity</b></heading>
<p id="p0185" num="0185">In an earlier publication, two putative targets for miR-34a - Notch1 and Delta 1, also called Delta-like 1 (DLL1) - were identified and validated indirectly, using a luciferase reporter assay (Lewis et al., 2003).</p>
<p id="p0186" num="0186">Notch is a transmembrane protein receptor that mediates interactions between adjacent cells and regulates cell fate decisions during development. In mammals four Notch genes (Notch1-4) have been cloned. Thus far, six Notch receptor-specific ligands (Delta1, 2, 3 and 4 as well as Jagged1 and 2) have also been identified in mammals (Radtke and Raj, 2003). Notch activation is initiated by interactions with ligands of the Delta and Jagged families and results in cleavage and release of the intracellular region of the Notch receptor followed by its nuclear translocation. In the nucleus it interacts with the transcription factor CBF1 (RBPjk) to transactivate target genes, including <i>Hey1</i> (Iso et al., 2001). Constitutively active intracellular forms of Notch have been shown to have oncogenic activity and to inhibit p53-mediated cell death (Kim et al., 2006; Mungamuri et al., 2006) by inhibiting p53 phosphorylation and transactivation. On the other hand, there is evidence that p53 indirectly inhibits Notch signaling either by sequestering p300/CBP (Pastorcic and Das, 2000), which is required for Notch activation or by p21-dependent down-regulation of presenilin 1 transcription (Roperch et al., 1998), which is necessary for Notch cleavage upon ligand binding. Our findings raise the interesting possibility that p53 may negatively regulate Notch signaling, at least partly, also via enhanced expression of microRNAs that bind and inactivate Notch pathway-related mRNAs.</p>
<p id="p0187" num="0187">In addition to the indirectly validated targets for miR-34a, Notch1 and DLL1, Jagl mRNA is also predicted to have putative target sites for this miR (SEQ ID NOS: 38-41) (<figref idref="f0027">Fig. 13A</figref>). Because all three mRNAs are predicted to be regulated by miR-34a, we checked the influence of manipulating this miR on the functionality of the Notch pathway.</p>
<p id="p0188" num="0188">As shown in <figref idref="f0028">Fig. 13B</figref>,<figref idref="f0029">D</figref>, down-regulation of miR-34a by LNA anti-miR-34a:<br/>
5'-aacaaccagctaagacactgcca-3' (SEQ ID NO: 36) in either A172 or MCF7 cells had no effect on the mRNA levels of DLL1, Jag1 or Notch1, but resulted in up-regulation of the expression of Heyl, a downstream transcriptional target of Notch pathway activation, as compared to the control scrambled LNA RNA: 5'-gtgtaacacgtctatacgccca-3' (SEQ ID NO: 37). A stronger effect was observed following p53 activation with Nutlin-3 (<figref idref="f0029">Fig. 13D</figref>), probably because of Nutlin-dependent induction of Jagl and Notch1 mRNA levels. In both cases, the mRNA expression levels of the three genes were similar when either scrambled or anti-miR-34a LNA oligos were added, suggesting that the differential effect on Heyl mRNA was achieved due to specific miR-34a down-regulation.</p>
<p id="p0189" num="0189">A complementary, opposite effect on Heyl expression was seen when miR-34a was overexpressed in A172 cells. Despite the absence of any change in the mRNA levels of DLL1, Jag1 and Notch1, miR-34a overexpression led to a reduction in Hey1 mRNA (<figref idref="f0028">Fig. 13C</figref>). To find out whether the inhibition of Notch signaling might contribute to the pro-apoptotic effect of miR-34a overexpression, we asked whether this effect can be rescued by experimental upregulation of Notch activity. To that end, MCF7 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3-pm34a-EST (EST) or a mutant, inactive derivative thereof (MUT), with or without addition of a constitutively active Notch expression plasmid, which does not contain the target sequence for miR-34a within its encoded mRNA. The viability of the cells was tested by FACS analysis. As shown in <figref idref="f0029">Fig. 13E</figref>, the increase in the subG1 population of cells transfected with pcDNA3-pm34a-EST, indicative of apoptosis, was decreased almost to the basal levels when Notch activity was reconstituted exogenously.</p>
<p id="p0190" num="0190">Collectively, the data indicate that p53 can regulate the Notch pathway by inducing miR-34a production, which in turn down-regulates the output of this pathway. This effect may be achieved through the combinatorial effect of downregulating modestly the expression of different components of the pathway. miR-34a may thus be a p53-induced antioncogenic guardian of the Notch pathway.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p>
<heading id="h0097"><b>Example 8</b></heading>
<heading id="h0098"><b>miR-34a regulates Bcl-2 expression</b></heading>
<p id="p0191" num="0191">One of the predicted targets of miR-34a is Bcl-2. Proteins in the Bcl-2 family are central regulators of programmed cell death (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004), and members that inhibit apoptosis, such as Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, are overexpressed in many cancers and contribute to tumor initiation, progression and resistance to therapy (Kirkin et al., 2004). Consistent with Bcl-2 mRNA being a target of miR-34a, we observed that Bcl-2 protein is decreased in miR-34a overexpressing cells (<figref idref="f0030">Fig. 14A</figref>). However, under those conditions, the decrease in Bcl-2 protein occurred without a measurable decrease in Bcl-2 mRNA (<figref idref="f0031">Fig. 14B</figref>). Hence, our study confirm that Bcl-2 is an authentic miR-34a target, the different effects on Bcl-2 mRNA imply that in some contexts miR-34a may act exclusively through translational inhibition of Bcl-2 synthesis, as demonstrated by us, whereas in other cases it may also promote the degradation of the corresponding mRNA. The factors that underlie the choice between these different options remain to be elucidated. It is noteworthy that Bcl-2 mRNA is also targeted very efficiently by miR-15a and miR-16-1 (Cimmino et al., 2005). It therefore appears very likely that miR-34a may act in cooperation with these other two candidate tumor-suppressor miRNAs to suppress Bcl-2 expression. This fact, together with the findings that reduced Bcl-2 activity increases sensitivity to anticancer drugs, induces regression of solid tumors (Bruncko et al., 2007; Oltersdorf et al., 2005) and extends animal survival in an experimental cancer model (Letai et al., 2004), raises an option for these microRNAs or derivatives thereof to be considered as a basis for innovative cancer therapies.</p>

<p id="p0192" num="0192">H1299 cells stably transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector or with a pcDNA3-based miR-34a expression plasmid are inoculated subcutaneously into CD1 nu/nu mice (male, 4-6-week-old, 10 mice/group) at 5x10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse. Tumor growth is assessed by palpation once a week for up to seven weeks or till tumor size reaches a size that calls for termination of the experiment. Tumor size is monitored by caliper measurement, and statistical analysis is performed to determine whether expression of miR-34a has an anti-tumor effect in this setting. At the end of the experiment, tumor specimens are collected for histological analysis as well as for extraction of RNA and analysis of gene expression patterns by Affymetrix microarrays, as well as of miR-34a expression levels (measured by qRT-PCR).</p>
