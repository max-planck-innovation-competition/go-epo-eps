<description id="desc" lang="en">
<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a specific physiologically active substance produced by recombinant DNA technique, and more particularly to a stable aqueous solution of powder containing this physiologically active substance and an effective amount of an albumin. This invention also relates to a method for stabilizing the said physiologically active substance which comprises adding an albumin to an aqueous solution or powder containing the physiologically active substance which is prepared by recombinant DNA technique and has an antitumor activity.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">It is known that there is a physiologically active substance which is derived from human and which has cytotoxic activity against L-M cells and is capable of inducing hemorrhagic necrosis of a transplanted tumor, Meth A sacroma, in the BALB/c mouse. Such a physiologically active substance has an antitumor activity and is called human Tumor Necrosis Factor (hereinafter often referred to as "human TNF"). It is also known that such a physiologically active substance has no toxic effect upon normal cells in vitro. Further, since the physiologically active substance is derived from human, there is no danger that anaphylactic shock might be caused due to the administration of a substance to a human which is not the origin of the substance. Therefore, expectations for the clinical application of the above-mentioned physiologically active substance as an antitumor medicine have been great in the art.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to ensure the wide and safe clinical application of human TNF as an antitumor medicine, it is required to obtain human TNF in highly purified form. Previously, there has been proposed a method for obtaining human TNF by recombinant DNA technique. According to the proposed method, the desired human TNF can be produced in substantially pure form on a large scale. The proposed method consists in:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
<li>ligating a deoxyribonucleic acid coding for human TNF to a replicable expression vehicle to obtain a replicable recombinant DNA comprising said deoxyribonucleic acid and said replicable expression vehicle,</li>
<li>transforming cells of a microorganism or cell culture with said replicable recombinant DNA to form transformants;</li>
<li>selecting said transformants from parent cells of the microorgranism or cell culture;</li>
<li>incubating said transformants, causing said transformants to express said deoxyribonucleic acid and produce human TNF; and</li>
<li>isolating said human TNF from the incubated transformants, followed by purification.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">As stated above, according to the proposed method using recombinant DNA technique, there can advantageously be obtained the desired human TNF in substantially pure form on a large scale. However, when large-scale production of human TNF to be used as an antitumor medicine is performed, it is usually needed to store the substantially pure human TNF in the form of a solution or a frozen mass over a prolonged period of time and lyophilize the active substance solution. However, the present inventors have found that the activity of substantially pure human TNF markedly drops on storing, freezing, thawing and lyophilizing it. Further, it is noted that during the storage of the substantially pure TNF produced by recombinant DNA technique until the TNF is actually administered to a patient suffering from cancer, the activity of the TNF also drops markedly. With respect to the stabilization of proteins having antitumor activity, there are publications such as USP 4,447,355 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification Nos. 59-39829 (1984) and 59-59625 (1984). However, as far as the present inventors are aware, there has been no report in which the stability of substantially pure human TNF produced by recombinant DNA technique is studied. Under these circumstances, the efficient and steady supply of the substantially pure human TNF, especially on a commercial scale cannot be ensured, despite the knowledge that the human TNF is an effective antitumor medicine.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">To overcome the above-elucidated difficulty with respect to the stability of the physiologically active substance, the present inventors have made extensive and intensive studies. As a result, it has been found, quite surprisingly, that there can be provided a stable aqueous solution or powder, comprising an effective amount of an albumin as a stabilizing agent and the physiologically active substance which substance may be stored over a prolonged period of time without losing its activity and has been rendered stable during the procedures of isolation and purification and on freezing, thawing, lyophilization or the like. Based on the novel finding, the present invention has been completed.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a stable aqueous solution or powder of a specific physiologically active substance which maintains its activity over a prolonged period of time and which is stable on freezing, thawing, lyophilization or the like.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">It is, another object of the present invention to provide a method for stabilizing the said physiologically active substance produced by recombinant DNA technique.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and appended claims taken in connection with <!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->the accompanying drawings in which:

<p id="p0010" num="0010">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for stabilizing a physiologically active substance, which comprises adding to an aqueous solution or powder containing, a physiologically active substance an effective amount of an albumin.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">said physiologically active substance being a specific one which is produced by recombinant DNA technique using a recombinant DNA containing a DNA coding for the physiologically active substance, and which has cytotoxic activity against L-M cells and is capable of inducing hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted Meth A sarcoma in the BALB/c mouse.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">As mentioned before, the specific physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention is one produced by a customary recombinant DNA technique using a recombinant DNA containing a DNA coding for the said physiologically active substance. When the physiologically active substance is subjected to assays according to the methods described later, the physiologically active substance exhibits cytotoxic activity against L-M cells and induces hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted Meth A sarcoma in the BALB/c mouse. Specifically, the said physiologically active substance is a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence represented by the following formula (I):<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="142" he="88" img-content="dna" img-format="tif" inline="no"/>wherein Gln stands for a glutamine residue, Asp as aspartic acid residue, Pro a proline residue, Tyr a tyrosine residue, Val a valine residue, Lys a lysine residue, Glu a glutamic acid residue, Ala an alanine residue, Asn an asparagine residue, Leu a leucine residue, Phe a phenylalanine residue, Gly a glycine residue, His a histidine residue, Ser a serine residue, Thr a threonine residue, Ile an isoleucine residue, Trp a tryptophan residue, Arg an arginine residue, Met a methionine residue, and Cys a cysteine residue.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The physiologically active substance having the above-mentioned amino acid sequence may be produced by a customary recombinant DNA technique using a recombinant DNA which contains a DNA coding for the physiologically active substance comprising at least one base sequence selected from the group consisting of a base sequence represented by the following formula (II) and a complementary base sequence to said base sequence:<img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="140" he="87" img-content="dna" img-format="tif" inline="no"/>wherein A stands for a deoxyadenylic acid residue, G a deoxyguanylic acid residue, C a deoxycytidylic acid residue and T thymidylic acid residue and wherein the left end and right end of the formula (II) represent 5'-hydroxyl group side and 3'-hydroxyl group side, respectively.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The above-mentioned physiologically active substance and the above mentioned DNA may be obtained as follows:<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
<li>1. A bacteriophage X/rabbit genomic library and a bacteriophage X/human genomic library prepared by Prof. T. Maniatis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Harvard University, 7 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, U.S.A. are used. These materials may be prepared according to the following procedures [see Cell, 15, p. 687 (1978)]:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
<li>(1) rabbit or human tissues, for example rabbit or human pancreas tissue, are reduced to frozen powder and treated to digest RNA and protein materials and provide, on precipitation, high molecular weight rabbit or human DNA;</li>
<li>(2) the high molecular weight DNA is partially digested for random cutting with respect to gene locus;</li>
<li>(3) the resultant DNA fragments are size-fractionated giving from 15 to 20 kilo base pair (kb) fragments;</li>
<li>(4) the resultant fragments of Step 3 are cloned using a Charon 4A phage vector; and</li>
<li>(5) the resultant vectors are packaged in vitro to infectious phage particles containing rDNA to obtain the above-mentioned rabbit or human genomic library.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2. The rabbit TNF cDNA obtained in Referential Example 1 is <sup>32</sup>P-labelled by P. W. J. Rigby et al's nick translation method [see J. Mol. Biol. 113, p.237 (1977)].</li>
<li>3. Each of the bacteriophage X/rabbit genomic library and bacteriophage X/human genomic library is plated to virtual confluence on a lawn of bacteria and screened from hybridization with the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled rabbit TNF cDNA.</li>
<li>4. From the appropriate clones, the corresponding DNA is isolated, restriction mapped and analyzed by Southern hybridization [see E. M. Southern, J. Mol. Biol., 98, p.503 (1975)]. Restriction fragments containing rabbit or human TNF genes are subcloned into plasmid vectors and then sequenced.</li>
<li>5. The base sequence of the rabbit TNF cDNA is compared with that of the rabbit TNF gene to determine the exons (certain sequences of bases which code for the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF) and introns (certain sequences of bases which do not code for the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF) of the rabbit TNF gene.</li>
<li>6. Thereafter, the base sequence of the human TNF gene is compared with that of the rabbit TNF gene to determine the exons and introns of the human TNF gene.</li>
<li>7. The amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF that has been deduced from the base sequence obtained by deleting the introns of the rabbit TNF gene and combining the exons thereof is affirmed to be in agreement with that deduced from the base sequence of the rabbit TNF cDNA.</li>
<li>8. Next, the amino acid sequence of the physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention is deduced from the base sequence of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance obtained by deleting the introns of the gene coding for the physiologically active substance and combining the exons thereof. The amino acid sequence of the physiologically active substance is affirmed to be partially in agreement with that of the rabbit TNF.</li>
<li>9. Then, the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance is tailored into vitro for insertion into an appropriate expression vehicle to form recombinant DNA containing the coding DNA. The recombinant DNA is used to transform an appropriate host cell which is, in turn, permitted to grow in a culture and to express the desired physiologically active substance.</li>
<li>10. The physiologically active substance thus produced has 155 amino acid residues in its mature form, beginning with serine. When it has a signal peptide in its presequence, the signal peptide is very hydrophobic in character.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The foregoing discloses the procedures for obtaining the gene coding for the physiologically active substance, the base sequence of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance and the process for producing the physiologically active substance by the use of the DNA. However, it will be understood that the foregoing disclosure is not intended to limit the method and that obvious changes may be made by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Due to the variable use frequency of a codon (genetic code) corresponding to each amino acid and for other reasons, a partial or entire portion of the base sequence of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance may be substituted by an organo-chemically synthesized artificial DNA without causing the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide obtained therefrom to be changed.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Presumably, the physiologically active substance may be intracellularly produced in immature form as a prepeptide or prepropeptide, which may be processed via an intermediate form to a mature physiologically active substance in the processing stage. The immature form of the physiologically active substance may be deduced from the base sequence of the human TNF gene. The DNA comprising a DNA encoding the physiologically active substance in immature or intermediate form may also be recombined with a natural or artificially synthesized DNA.</p><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->
<p id="p0018" num="0018">One application of this technique may be attained by inserting the methionine codon (ATG) in the 5'- end and inserting at least one stop codon selected from TAA, TAG and TGA in the 3'-end of the mature or intermediate or immature TNF DNA. Due to the presence of the methionine coden, the mature or intermediate or immature physiologically active substance may be produced on the mRNA synthesized with the aid of an appropriate promotor. However, the methionine residue attached to the N-terminus of the physiologically active substance is cleaved or not cleaved according to the kind of the host cell employed. The purpose of inserting the stop codon is to stop translation of the mRNA transcripted from the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance at an appropriate position (C-terminus of polypeptide of the formula I).</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">Another application of this technique may be attained by adding to the DNA a higly hydrophobic base sequence known as a "signal sequence". By this addition, it may become feasible to secrete the physiologically active substance to outside the host cell or, in the case of a gram-negative bacterium, into the space known as "periplasm".</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">When a vector in which a start codon is incorporated is employed, a fused peptide may be produced which consists of the physiologically active substance and a peptide attributed to the vector. In this case, the fused peptide may be cleaved chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the fused peptide, if the main activity of the physiologically active substance is not adversely affected, may be used as it is.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">The DNA coding for the physiologically active substance may be connected, at its region upstream of the 5'-end, to the gene sequence of a promoter thereby to obtain a TNF DNA-promoter sequence which does not hinder its replication and does not cause translation of the resultant RNA to be adversely affected. The thus obtained TNF DNA-promoter sequence may be combined with a vector which is replicable in a bacterium or higher organism cell to obtain a recombinant DNA. The thus obtained recombinant DNA may be used to transform a bacterium or higher organism cell used as a host. The thus obtained transformant may be cultured to effect expression of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance in order to produce the physiologically active substance.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">When Escherichia coli is used as the above-mentioned host, there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, various mutant strains of E, coli K-12, such as HB101 (ATCC 33694), C600K (ATCC 33955), D1210, RRI (ATCC 31343), MC1061, LE392 (ATCC 33572), JM101 (ATCC 33876), JM83, and <sub>x</sub>1776 (ATCC 31244). When the E, coli host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable vector, plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pBR327, pUC3, pUC9, pMB9 (ATCC 37019), pJB8 (ATCC 37074) and pKC7 (ATCC 37084), phages such as Xgt, XB and Charon 4A, and M13 phage. To have the active substance produced in the E, coli cell, a promoter selected from the promoters of the E, coli and phage genes may be employed. Examples of the suitable promoter include the genes for lactose degradation enzyme (LAC), UV5 mutant thereof, penicillinase (BLA) and tryptophan synthetase (TRP), phage P<sub>L</sub> promoter and tac promoter which is a fused promoter of tryptophan synthetase and lactose degradation enzyme.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">When Bacillus subtilis is used as the host, there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, BD170 strain (ATCC 33608), BR151 strain (ATCC 33677) and M1112 strain (ATCC 33712). When the Bacillus subtilis host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable vector, plasmids pC194 (ATCC 37034), pUB110 (ATCC 37015), pSA2100 (ATCC 37014) and pE194. Further, when the Bacillus substilis host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable promoter, the genes for chloramphenicol acetylation enzyme (CAT), penicillinase and anti-erythromycin.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">When a yeast is used as the host, there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae such as RH218 (ATCC 44076), SHY1 (ATCC 44769), SHY3 (ATCC 44771), D131A, 483 and 830. When the yeast host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable vector, plasmids such as YEp13 (ATCC 37115), YEp6, YRp7 and Ylp5. Further, when the yeast host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable promoter, the genes for acid phosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHI), tryptophan synthetase (TRP), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), cytochrome B (COB) and actin.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The thus prepared transformant is cultured on a large scale according to a customary method to produce the desired physiologically active substance. Then, the supernatant of the culture or a cell extract is collected to obtain a crude physiologically active substance.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">The crude physiologically active substance produced by any of the methods as set forth above may be purified using the below-cited conventional biochemical techniques singly or in combination to give an aqueous purified physiologically active substance solution, which is lyophilized to give a purified physiologically active substance powder. As the suitable biochemical technique for purification of the active substance, there can be mentioned, for example, a salting-out technique in which ammonium sulfate is employed, an ion exchange chromatography in which an anion exchange resin is employed, a gel filtration technique and an electrophoresis technique. As the purity of the active substance is increased by practicing the above techniques for purification, it is recognized that the active substance gradually becomes instable. <!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->For example, a sample of the physiologically active substance so purified as to have a specific activity of 500,000 units/mg (the specific activity is expressed as units of activity per mg of protein; the unit of activity is defined later) is quite instable as seen from the data given in the Examples. Even the samples having a specific activity lower than 500,000 units/mg also experience a decrease of the respective activity in some degree when they are in storage or subjected to freezing, thawing, lyophilization and other operations.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the stabilization of the physiologically active substance that has been purified to a high degree and has been rendered instable. The active substance to be stabilized according to the present invention may be either in the form of a solution or powder. However, it is preferred that the active substance to be stabilized be in the form of a solution.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">It is preferred that the solution of the physiologically active substance to be stabilized according to the present invention constantly have a pH value of from 5 to 10, and further, it is preferred that the solvent from the solution to be stabilized be a suitable buffer. As the suitable buffer, there can be mentioned, for example, a phosphate buffer and a tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-HCI buffer. According to need, a salt, such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, is added to the solution. For example, a salt is added to the solution so as to prepare an isotonic solution, when the solution is used for injection. The purpose of addition of a salt is not limited to the above. The concentration of such a salt in the solution, may be determined, depending on the purpose of addition of the salt. For example, when the ultimate TNF solution is used for injection, an isotonic solution is prepared from the solution by addition of sodium chloride up to a concentration of 0.15M.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">According to the method of the present invention, an effective amount of an albumin is added to an aqueous solution or powder containing the physiologically active substance.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">As the suitable albumin, there can be mentioned human albumin and bovine albumin. There may also be mentioned albumins from various animals, such as horse, sheep, goat and chicken. As specific examples of the suitable albumin, there can be mentioned bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, bovine lactalbumin, human lactalbumin and albumin derived from human placenta. No significant difference is observed, in respect of the ability to stabilize the active substance, between the above-mentioned albumins. As the stabilizing agent for injection preparations, however, human serum albumin is most preferable. The above-mentioned albumins may be purified according to customary methods before use.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The albumin to be employed in the present invention is added to the solution in an amount of about 1 I.Lg or more, preferably 10 µg or more, especially preferably 100 µg or more, per ml of the solution having a cytotoxic activity against L-M cells of 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> units/ml (the unit of activity is defined later). The upper limit of the amount of the albumin is usually determined from the viewpoints of the solubility of the albumin and viscosity of the resulting solution and from the economical viewpoint. The upper limit of the amount of albumin is generally 50 mg, preferably 10 mg, per ml of the TNF solution. When the active substance to be stabilized is in a powdery form, the albumin is added to the powder such an amount as will cause an aqueous solution, which is obtained by dissolving the powdery physiologically active substance to exhibit an activity of 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> units/ml, to have the above-mentioned concentrations of the albumin.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The way in which the albumin is added is not critical. For example, the albumin in a powdery form may be directly added to the active substance solution. Alternatively, the powder of the albumin may be dissolved, in advance, in water or a suitable buffer, and added to the solution. Further, alternatively, the powder of the albumin may be mixed with the powder of the active substance. Addition of the albumin may be effected at any time during the purification step or the step of manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">It is preferred that storing and purification of and manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations from the physiologically active substance solution in which an albumin to be employed according to the present invention is incorporated, if kept in the form of a solution, be performed at a temperature of from 0 to 30 °C, more preferably from 0 to 10<sub>°</sub>C. When the solution is stored in a frozen form, it is preferred that the temperature for storage be maintained below 0 <sub>° </sub>C, more preferably below -20 <sub>° </sub>C.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">The solution in which an effective amount of an albumin, according to the present invention, is incorporated does maintain its activity during the storing, whether it is in the form of a solution or in a frozen form, or during the steps of purification and manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Further, the method for stabilizing the physiologically active substance of the present invention, is also applicable to lyophilization. Illustratively stated, when solutions of the physiologically active substance (especially, in the case of highly purified active substance) are subjected to lyophilization, the activities thereof generally markedly drop. However, the solutions containing an effective amount of an albumin, according to the present invention, are lyophilized without losing its activity to give a powder of the physiologically active substance. The powder may be dissolved to give a stable aqueous solution in which the concentrations of the albumin and the active substance fall within the range as defined above. The <!-- EPO <DP n="9"> -->albumin may, alternatively be incorporatedc in the lyophilized preparations of the physiologically active substances. When the physiologically active substance is stored in a powdery form, it is preferred that the temperature for storage be maintained at room temperature or below.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">In the below-mentioned in vivo assay in which a Meth A sarcoma transplanted mouse is used, when 300 units of the purified physiologically active substance which has been stabilized according to the present invention is administered to the mouse, the activity is evaluated as (+). Also, significant growth inhibition or regression of the cancer is observed after administration of the purified physiologically active substance, as compared with control mice which are injected with a physiological saline, in the mice which have been transplanted with colon carcinoma Colon 26. Further, the cytotoxic activity against various cancer cells of the purified physiologically active substance is evaluated in substantially the same manner as the in vitro assay method as mentioned later except that KB cells (adenocarcinoma), PC-8 cells (lung cancer), and normal cells (fetal human kidney cells and fetal human foreskin cells) as control are used instead of L-M cells and the cells are incubated at 37 <sub>° </sub>C for 72 hours instead of at 37 <sub>° </sub>C for 48 hours. As a result, the purified physiologically active substance exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against the cancer cells while exhibiting no cytotoxic activity against the normal cells. To assay the activity of TNF, there are usually employed two methods, i.e. the in vivo method in which the tumor necrosis effect is measured in vivo, and the in vitro method in which the cytotoxic effect on neoplastic cells is measured in vitro.</p>
<heading id="h0001">(1) In vivo assay method</heading>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">As the in vivo method, there can be mentioned, for example, the method of Carswell et al [see Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 72(9), 3666-3670 (1975)]. According to this method, Meth A cells (2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells) are transplanted intradermally at armpit of each of BALB/c mice and, 7 days later, mice with tumors of 7-8 mm in diameter, good vascularization and no spontaneous central necrosis are selected for evaluation. A sample (0.5 ml) diluted with a physiological saline solution is injected through the tail vein of each of the mice. The activity of the sample is evaluated after 24 hours according to the following criterion.

<heading id="h0002">(2) In vitro assay method</heading>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">As the in vitro method for the assay of activity, there can be mentioned, for example, the method of Ruff et al [see Lymphokines, Vol. 2, edited by E. Pick, Academic Press, N.Y. 245-248 (1980)] and the method of Kull et al [see J. Immunol., 126 (4), 1279-1283 (1981)].</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The in vitro method that the present inventors have employed for the assay of activity has been developed by improving the above-mentioned conventional methods. The in vitro method of the present inventors, in which the cytotoxic activity of TNF against L-M cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL 1.2) is measured, is carried out as follows. As culture vessel, there are employed 96-well microtiter plates produced by Flow Laboratories, Inc. (U.S.A.), and L-M cells are cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium [see Science, 130, 432-437 (1959)] containing 10 v/v% fetal calf serum. A sample (0.1 ml) serially diluted with the medium and the L-M cell suspension (0.1 ml, 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells) are mixed in each well of the plates and the plates are incubated at 37 <sub>° </sub>C for 48 hours in an air containing 5% carbon dioxide. At the end of the culture period, a 20% aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde (20 µl) is added to fix the cells. After fixation, the plates are washed with distilled water and allowed to dry, and 0.05% methylene blue (0.1 ml) is added to stain the viable cells. The plates are thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove excess dye and allowed to dry. 3% Hydrochloric acid (0.2 ml) is added to each well to extract the dye from stained cells. Absorbance of each well at 665 nm is measured with Titertek Multiskan produced by Flow Laboratories, Inc., USA. The absorbance is proportional to the number of viable cells. The activity, unit(U)-/ml, is defined as the reciprocal dilution of TNF that causes 50% cytotoxicity, and can be obtained by plotting the dilution versus the absorbance on a graph. All the activities, assayed according to the in vitro method, as used hereinafter are expressed by the above-defined unit except in Referential Examples 1 and 2. In Referential Examples 1 and 2, the activity is evaluated in substantially the same manner as described above except that L929 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL 1) are used instead of L-M cells and Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 1 v/v% fetal calf serum and 5 µg/rnl acetinomycin D is used <!-- EPO <DP n="10"> -->instead of Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10 v/v% fetal calf serum, and that the incubation is effected for 21 hours instead of 48 hours.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">According to the method of the present invention, efficient and steady supply, on a commercial scale, of the highly purified physiologically active substance, which is believed to be a clinically applicable effective antitumor medicine, can be ensured because in the method of the present invention, the activity of the active substance is maintained during the storing, whether the active substance is in the form of a solution, a frozen mass or a lyophilized preparation, and during the steps of purification and manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations. It has also been found that the solution or powder, in which human albumin is incorporated, can be safely administered to the human body, wherefore the novel composition of the present invention is especially useful when the physiologically active substance is clinically applied as an antitumor medicine.</p>

Eight days later, 100 µg of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 026:B6, produced by Difco Laboratories, U.S.A.) is injected again through the ear vein and 2 hours later whole blood is collected from the heart. To the collected blopod, heparin sodium is added in an amount of 100 units per 100 ml. The blood is then centrifuged while cooling at 5,000 rpm for 30 minutes to remove blood cells and insoluble solids. As a result, a plasma (2.4 liters) having a serum TNF cytotoxic activity of 3 x 10<sup>4</sup> units/ml is obtained from 40 rabbits.</p>

<p id="p0137" num="0137">The replicative form of mp9-HGEA3-1 is digested with EcoRl. The EcoRl fragment is isolated and cloned to EcoRl-cleaved pBR327 to yield the plasmid pHGEAA3-1.</p>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">Construction of further plasmid is carried out using plasmid pHGEA3-1 in order to obtain such plasmid A3-1 as will directly express. TNF in E, coli using lac UV5 as a promoter. The procedures are illustratively shown in Fig. 7. First, 10 µg of plasmid pHGEA3-1 is digested with 10 units of Aval and EcoRl (manufactured and sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A.) at 37°C for two hours and electrophoresed on a 4% by weight polyacrylamide gel to isolate fragments. About 1 µg of fragment is isolated from the gel by electroelution. In the same manner as in Step 14, two oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Fig. 7, namely 5'-AATTCATGTCATCTTCTCGAACC-3' and 5'-TCGGGGTTCGAGAAGATGACATG-3' are synthesized. Then, each 5' end of the two oligodeoxynucleotides (about 100 pmole) is phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase in accordance with the method described in Literature (3), page 122. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is extracted with phenol and then with chloroform. Then the so-obtained synthetic oligomers are mixed with 0.5 µg of the previously obtained Aval-EcoRl fragment from <!-- EPO <DP n="29"> -->plasmid pHGEA3-1 and ethanol precipitated. These fragments are ligated at 4° C overnight using 10 units of T4 ligase in accordance with the procedure described in Literature (1), page 37. After completion of the reaction, the mixture is ethanol precipitated, followed by electrophoresis effected on a 4% by weight polyacrylamide gel to recover fragment by electroelution.</p>
<p id="p0139" num="0139">In accordance with the procedure described in F. Fuller, "Gene", 19, pp. 42-54 (1982), plasmid pOP95-15 is prepared.</p>
<p id="p0140" num="0140">One µg of pOP 95-15 is digested with EcoRl and extracted with phenol and then with chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation to obtain a vector. Using T4 DNA ligase, 0.5 µg of the obtained vector is ligated with the above-obtained fragment. In accordance with the procedure described in Literature (4), page 20, E, coli JM101 (ATCC 33876) is transformed using the above-obtained vector and cultivated on an agar medium containing 1 mM of IPTG and 0.004 w/v % x-gal to obtain about 100 white colonies.</p>
<p id="p0141" num="0141">Plasmid DNA is prepared from these transformants and digested with EcoRl to identify those plasmids containing the intended EcoRi fragment. In order to examine the direction of insertion, those plasmids are digested with Pvull and Pstl and electrophoresed on a 1.5% by weight agarose gel to select plasmids yielding fragments of about 1280 base pairs and about 2600 base pairs indicating that the direction of transcription of the lac UV5 promoter is in agreement with those of the oligodeoxynucleotides coding for TNF.</p>
<p id="p0142" num="0142">Base sequence analysis shows that these 2 plasmids have the same sequence and that the lac UV5 promoter, the synthesized oligodeoxynucleotide and DNA are properly combined with each other. The obtained plasmids is designated pHTNF-lacUV5-2.</p>
<p id="p0143" num="0143">E, coli containing pHTNF-lacUV5-2 is cultured in a conventional nutrient medium. Bioassay of the product for TNF activity indicates almost the same activity which is obtained with a plasmid pTNF-lacUV5-1 containing the rabbit TNF gene under control of the lac promoter.</p>
<heading id="h0073">Referential Example 3</heading>
<p id="p0144" num="0144">Using the plasmid pHGE and oligodeoxynucleotides 1 to 4 obtained by the procedure described in Steps 1 to 14 of Referential Example 2, pHTNF-lacUV5-1 is prepared in accordance with the procedure illustrated in Fig. 6.</p>
<heading id="h0074">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p0145" num="0145">E, coli containing pHTNF-lacUV5-2 prepared in Referential Example 3 is cultured in a conventional nutrient medium and subjected to induction according to a customary method. The E, coli is further cultured to obtain cells of E, coli containing the physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention. The cells are collected by centrifugation and subjected to cell lysis by sonication in 1 I of 0.04 M Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.8) to obtain a cell extract containing the physiologically active substance. The cell extract exhibits a cytotoxic activity of 4.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> U/ml. A specific activity of the active substance in the extract is 3.0 x 10<sup>4</sup> U/mg-protein.</p>
<p id="p0146" num="0146">Then, the extract is applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (manufactured by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Sweden) column sufficiently equilibrated with 0.04 M Tris-HCI buffer (pH 8.0). The column is washed with 0.04 M Tris-HCI buffer (pH 8.0) and, thereafter, the elution is effected using 0.04 M Tris-HCI buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 M NaCI. Active fractions are pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration, thereby to obtain a crude solution containing the active substance having a specific activity of 4.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> U/mg-protein.</p>
<p id="p0147" num="0147">The thus obtained crude solution is applied on a Sephacryl S-200 (manufactured by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Sweden) column equilibrated with 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 M NaCI, followed by gel filtration using the same buffer. Active fractions are pooled and concentrated by ultra- filtration, thereby to obtain a solution containing the physiologically active substance having a specific activity of 7.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> U/mg-protein. An aliquot of the obtained solution is diluted with 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 M NaCl to prepare a solution of the physiologically active substance having a cytoxic activity of 120 U/ml.</p>
<p id="p0148" num="0148">To aliquots of the thus obtained solution is separately added each of HSA (human serum albumin) and BSA (Bovine serum albumin) to form sample solutions having albumin concentrations as indicated in Table 5. For each of the resulting sample solutions, the remaining activity is determined with respect to the samples which are respectively subjected to storing for 2 days, 7 days and 30 days at 4 <sub>° </sub>C. In carrying out the above test, the active substance solution in which no albumin is incorporated is used as control.</p>
<p id="p0149" num="0149">To determine the remaining activity, the activity of each sample is assayed in vitro or in vivo, according to the methods as described hereinbefore. In the in vitro method, the remaining activity (%) is calculated <!-- EPO <DP n="30"> -->from the assay value according to the following equation:<maths id="math0002" num=""><img id="ib0016" file="imgb0016.tif" wi="60" he="14" img-content="math" img-format="tif" inline="no"/></maths>(wherein A is the cytotoxic activity of the sample after storing or physical treatment and B is the cytotoxic activity of the sample before storing or physical treatment)</p>
<p id="p0150" num="0150">In the in vivo method, each sample solution is concentrated to have a concentration 20 times that at start by means of the Mini-Module NM-3 (trade mark of the ultra-filtration equipment manufactured by Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., Japan and sold by Funakoshi Yakuhin, Japan). Then, 0.5 ml of each of the thus concentrated TNF solutions is injected, through the tail vein, into each of a group of five tumor-bearing mice. The antitumor activity was assayed 24 hours later in accordance with the criterion as described hereinbefore. The results obtained are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 8.</p>
<heading id="h0075">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p0151" num="0151">Substantially the same procedures as in example 1 are repeated to prepare sample solutions as described in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p0152" num="0152">For each of the solutions, the remaining activity is determined with respect to i) the samples respectively subjected to one cycle and three cycles of freezing (-70 <sub>° </sub>C) and thawing and ii) the samples subjected to freezing at -70 <sub>° </sub>C, lyophilization and storing at room temperature for 7 days. In carrying out the above test, the active substance solution containing no albumin is used as control. With respect to the lyophilized preparation [see ii) above], it is dissolved in sterile distilled water and then subjected to assay of the cytotoxic activity. The remaining activity of each sample is assayed in vivo or in vitro as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 5.</p>
<heading id="h0076">Comparative Example</heading>
<p id="p0153" num="0153">To aliquots of the human TNF solution having the same cytotoxic activity as that employed in Example 1, each of various amino acids, metal salts and chelating agents, which are well-known stabilizing agents for the solutions of ordinary physiologically active substances, is separately added in a varied concentration, as shown in Table 6. Each of the resulting solutions is stored at 4 <sub>° </sub>C for 7 days, and subjected to the assay of the antitumor activity according to the in vivo assay method. The remaining activity (%) is calculated in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 6.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> -->
