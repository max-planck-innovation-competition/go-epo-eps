<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel fructosyl peptide oxidase, to a fructosyl peptide oxidase gene encoding the same, and to a method for producing the novel fructosyl peptide oxidase.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Glycated protein is a non-enzymatically-glycated protein, which is produced as a result of covalent bonding between an aldehyde group of sugar, namely, aldose (i.e., a monosaccharide potentially associated with an aldehyde group, and derivatives thereof), and an amino group of a protein. Examples of the amino group of the protein include an N-terminal α-amino group and an internal lysine residue side chain ε-amino group. These glycated proteins are also referred to as Amadori compounds for being formed upon Amadori rearrangement of a Schiff base, a reaction intermediate product.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The glycated proteins are contained in body fluid such as blood in body or in a biological sample such as hair. The concentration of the glycated protein in blood strongly depends on the concentration of saccharide such as glucose dissolved in serum. In diabetic conditions, production of the glycated protein is accelerated. A concentration of glycated hemoglobin in erythrocytes and a concentration of glycated albumin in serum indicate an average blood sugar level for the past predetermined period. Therefore, quantification of the glycated proteins is important for diagnosis and control of the disease process of diabetes.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Examples of known conventional methods for quantifying a glycated protein include, for example, a method employing high-performance liquid chromatography (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Chromatogr. Sci., 10, 659 (1979</text></nplcit>)), a method using a column loaded with a solid material bound with boric acid (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Clin. Chem., 28, 2088-2094 (1982</text></nplcit>)), a method employing electrophoresis (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Clin. Chem., 26, 1598-1602 (1980</text></nplcit>)), a method using antigen-antibody reaction (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>JJCLA, 18, 620 (1993</text></nplcit>)), a colorimetric method for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> determining reducibility using tetrazolium salt (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Clin. Chim. Acta, 127, 87-95 (1982</text></nplcit>)), a colorimetric method using thiobarbituric acid following oxidation (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Clin. Chim. Acta, 112, 197-204 (1981</text></nplcit>)), a method using an enzyme such as glycated amino acid oxidase (Japanese Patent Examined Publication (kokoku) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP5033997A"><text>05-33997</text></patcit>, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP11127895A"><text>11-127895</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9713872A"><text>WO97-13872</text></patcit>, Japanese Patent Examined Publication (kokoku) No.<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP6065300A"><text> 6-65300</text></patcit>, and Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open (kohyo) Nos. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2195900A"><text>2-195900</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP3155780A"><text>3-155780</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP4004874A"><text>4-4874</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP5192193A"><text>5-192193</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP6046846A"><text>6-46846</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="JP11155596A"><text>11-155596</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="JP10313893A"><text>10-313893</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="JP11504808A"><text>11-504808</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="JP2000333696A"><text>2000-333696</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="JP2001054398A"><text>2001-54398</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="JP2001204495A"><text>2001-204495</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="JP2001204494A"><text>2001-204494</text></patcit>). Furthermore, a new method for quantifying a glycated protein was disclosed recently which is more accurate than any of the above-mentioned methods (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="JP2001095598A"><text>2001-95598</text></patcit>). According to this quantification method, a sample containing a glycated protein is treated with protease to release a fructosyl peptide from the glycated protein, which is then exposed to oxidase. The resulting product is quantified for quantification of the glycated protein. This method has been recognized as an accurate quantification method that requires short time and simple manipulation.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">According to the conventional method using glycated amino acid oxidase, a glycated protein is treated with protease and then the produced glycated amino acid is quantified enzymatically. Specifically, according to this method, a glycated protein is treated with protease or the like to give fructosyl amino acid, which is then exposed to fructosyl amino acid oxidase to quantify the produced hydrogen peroxide. Examples of known fructosyl amino acid oxidases that can be used in such quantification method include oxidase produced by <i>Corynebacterium</i> (Japanese Patent Examined Publications (kokoku) Nos. <patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="JP5033997A"><text>5-33997</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="JP6065300A"><text>6-65300</text></patcit>), oxidase produced by <i>Aspergillus</i> (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="JP3155780A"><text>3-155780</text></patcit>), oxidase produced by <i>Gibberella</i> (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="JP7289253A"><text>7-289253</text></patcit>), oxidase produced by <i>Fusarium</i> (Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open (kohyo) Nos. <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="JP7289253A"><text>7-289253</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="JP8154672A"><text>8-154672</text></patcit>), oxidase produced by <i>Penicillium</i> (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No.<patcit id="pcit0024" dnum="JP8336386A"><text> 8-336386</text></patcit>), oxidase produced by <i>Tricosporon</i> (Japanese Patent Application<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0025" dnum="JP2000245454A"><text>2000-245454</text></patcit>), and ketoamine oxidase (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="JP5192193A"><text>5-192193</text></patcit>). However, while these enzymes act well on fructosyl amino acids, they do not act on fructosyl peptides. Oxidase produced by E. <i>coli</i> DH5α (pFP1) (FERM BP-7297) described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0027" dnum="JP2001095598A"><text>2001-95598</text></patcit> is known as an enzyme that acts on fructosyl peptide. However, preparing a quantification kit with this enzyme is difficult since its basic physicochemical properties arc unknown and it has poor stability.</p>

<heading id="h0013">B. Determination assay</heading>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">2.7 ml of Reagent 1, 100 µl of Reagent 2 and 100 µl of enzyme solution are mixed and pre-heated at 30°C for 5 minutes. Then, 100 µl of Reagent 3 is added and thoroughly mixed to determine absorbance at 510 nm using a spectrophotometer (U-2000A, Hitachi, Ltd.). Measurement values indicate changes in the absorbance per minute at 510 nm after 1 to 3 minutes. A control solution was prepared in the same manner as described above except 100 µl ion exchange water was added instead of 100 µl Reagent 3. A standard solution of hydrogen peroxide and ion exchange water were used instead of Reagent 3 and the enzyme solution, respectively, to prepare a graph showing relationship with respect to the level of color. Referring to this graph, micromole of hydrogen peroxide produced per minute at 30°C is calculated and used as the unit for expressing the activity of the enzyme solution. The presence of action on ε-fructosyl lysine can be determined in the same manner by using Reagent 3 (substrate solution) containing ε-fructosyl lysine substrate instead of fructosyl valyl histidine substrate.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">Thus, the oxidases act on fructosyl valyl histidine in the presence of oxygen and catalyze reaction represented by the above-described formula which results in α-ketoaldehyde, valyl histidine and hydrogen peroxide. Such oxidases may, for example, have the above-described behavior and any or a combination of the above-described physicochemical properties. Such oxidases act efficiently upon free fructosyl valyl histidine resulting from protease treatment of a sample containing a glycated protein such as glycated hemoglobin, and thus can be used as an effective enzyme for quantifying the glycated protein. The oxidases having high thermostability are particularly preferable for use as a clinical diagnostic enzyme.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">When a sample containing a glycated protein is treated with protease, ε-fructosyl lysine may also be released together with fructosyl valyl histidine depending on the sample used. In this case, when the amount of fructosyl valyl histidine is determined with the oxidase which acts well on ε-fructosyl lysine, accurate determination may be difficult. In such case, the oxidase that has less action on ε-fructosyl lysine is more preferable.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The oxidases herein can be acquired from nature by conducting searches of enzymes derived from microorganisms, animals and plants. For example, in order to search for microorganisms capable of producing the oxidases, microorganisms are cultured in media supplied with an enzyme-producing inducer such as fructosyl valyl histidine. The obtained microorganism cells are disrupted to test for fructosyl peptide oxidase activities using fructosyl valyl histidine as a substrate. Thus, microorganisms capable of producing the oxidases can be obtained. The microorganisms used here may be newly isolated from soil, or obtained from a microorganism collection organization or the like. Furthermore, in order to obtain the oxidases with superior storage stability, solutions containing the disrupted microorganism cells obtained as described above may be subjected to a heat<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> treatment, for example, at 45°C for 10 minutes, after which activities are determined and those with higher remaining activities are selected. As organisms capable of producing the oxidases of the invention, in terms of easy handling, productivity and the like, for example, microorganisms are preferable, particularly filamentous fungi that belong to genus such as <i>Achaetomiella, Achaetomium, Thielavia, Chaetomium, Gelasinospora, Microascus, Coniochaeta</i> and <i>Eupenicillium.</i> Preferable microorganisms may be filamentous fungi belonging to <i>Achaetomiella, Chaetomium, Coniochaeta</i> and <i>Eupenicillium,</i> particularly microorganisms such as <i>Achaetomiella virescens</i> ATCC 32393, <i>Chaetomium</i> sp.

As microorganisms capable of producing the oxidases that have less action on ε-fructosyl lysine, filamentous fungi are preferable, such as those that belong to <i>Eupenicillium</i> and <i>Coniochaeta.</i> Preferable filamentous fungi are, for example, <i>Eupenicillium terrenum</i> ATCC 18547, <i>Eupenicillium senticosum</i> IFO 9158, <i>Eupenicillium idahoense</i> IFO 9510, <i>Eupenicillium euglaucum</i> IFO 31729 and <i>Coniochaeta</i> sp.

<p id="p0052" num="0052">The oxidases herein are obtained not only by modifying native oxidases by techniques such as gene engineering or mutation process but also by modifying conventionally known enzyme genes such as fructosyl amino acid oxidase genes.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Examples of such modification techniques include, for example, irradiating organisms capable of producing the above-described oxidases with UV ray, X-ray, radiation or the like, or bringing organisms capable of producing the above-described oxidases into contact with a mutagen such as ethylmethanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or nitrous acid, thereby obtaining a microorganism that produces modified oxidase herein. Then, from the obtained microorganism, the oxidase herein can be obtained. In general, gene engineering can be employed to modify genes encoding oxidases with different properties so as to obtain the oxidases herein.</p>
<p id="p0054" num="0054">Hereinafter, a method for producing the oxidases will be described. According to the present disclosure, the oxidases are collected and produced from organisms having activities of the oxidases, according to a variety of generally employed methods for isolating proteins. For example, a preferable method for producing the present oxidase comprises culturing a microorganism capable of producing the above-described oxidase in a medium, and collecting from the culture a protein having a fructosyl peptide oxidase activity or a protein having a fructosyl peptide oxidase activity but having less action on ε-fructosyl lysine. Specifically, as an example, the following method may be employed which uses a microorganism capable of producing the oxidase.</p>
<p id="p0055" num="0055">First, searched microorganisms that are found to produce the oxidases (collectively referred to as "the microorganisms") are cultured. The microorganisms may be cultured by a solid culture method but more preferably by a liquid culture method. As the media for culturing the above-mentioned microorganisms, one or more types of inorganic salts such as potassium dihydrogenphosphate, dipotassium hydrogenphosphate, magnesium sulfate, ferric chloride, ferric sulfate and manganese sulfate, and, if necessary, sugars, vitamins or the like, are added to one or<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> more types of nitrogen sources such as infusions of yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, corn steep liquor, soybean or wheat malt. As an enzyme inducible substrate, an enzyme substrate such as fructosyl glycine, fructosyl valyl histidine, ε-fructosyl lysine or the like may appropriately be added to increase the yield.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">Initial pH of the medium may suitably be adjusted to 7 to 9. Preferably, culture is performed at 25-42°C, preferably at about 30°C, for 1 to 5 days by submerged aeration culture, shake culture, standing culture or the like. Following culture, the oxidases of the invention may be collected from the cultures with generally employed enzyme collecting means.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">Specifically, cells are separated from the culture solutions, for example, by filtration, centrifugation or the like and then washed. The oxidases are preferably collected from these cells. These cells can be used directly. However, it is more preferable to disrupt the cells with disrupting means such as an ultrasonic homogenizer, a French Press, a Dynomill and the like, disrupt the cells by lysing cell walls of the cells with a cell wall lytic enzyme such as lysozyme, or extract the enzymes from the cells by using a surfactant such as Triton X-100 so as to collect the oxidases from these cells.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">A general enzyme purification method may be employed to purify and isolate the oxidases from the obtained crude enzyme solutions. Preferably, a combination of, for example, ammonium sulfate salting out method, organic solvent precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, absorption chromatography, electrophoresis and the like may be performed. Thus, the oxidases may be isolated until a generally single band appears on SDS-PAGE. The above-mentioned purification methods can suitably be combined to prepare enzyme preparations with different degrees of purification according to use. The oxidases that have less<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> action on ε-fructosyl lysine may also be produced according to a method similar to the above-described method for producing the oxidases herein.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The produced oxidases may effectively be used for quantifying a glycated protein as described below. First, a glycated protein such as HbA<sub>1c</sub> is digested by protease such as Molsin, AO-protease, peptidase (available from Kikkoman Corp.), carboxypeptidase Y or Protin P (available from Daiwa Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.) to release fructosyl peptide. Then, the released fructosyl valyl histidine is quantified with the oxidase. When ε-fructosyl lysine which is also released at the same time causes a problem, an enzyme that acts on ε-fructosyl lysine, for example, fructosyl amino acid oxidase derived from fungus (Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open (kohyo) Nos. <patcit id="pcit0030" dnum="JP7289253A"><text>7-289253</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0031" dnum="JP8154672A"><text>8-154672</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0032" dnum="JP8336386A"><text>8-336386</text></patcit>, etc.) or fructosyl amine oxidase (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kohyo) No. <patcit id="pcit0033" dnum="JP3155780A"><text>03-155780</text></patcit>) may be used to digest the ε-fructosyl lysine. Subsequently, fructosyl valyl histidine can be quantified with the oxidase of the invention. Alternatively, an oxidase that has less action on ε-fructosyl lysine may be used so that fructosyl valyl histidine can accurately be quantified without digesting the released ε-fructosyl lysine.</p>

For example, when a signal from a non-specific hybrid is positively detected, the hybridization and washing temperatures can be raised while the salt concentration is decreased, thereby enhancing specificity. When a signal from a specific hybrid is not detected, the hybridization and washing temperatures can be decreased while the salt concentration is increased, thereby stabilizing the hybrid. More specifically, DNA that is subjected to hybridization under stringent conditions may have a certain homology with a nucleotide sequence of probe DNA. Homology as used in "DNA comprising a nucleotide sequence indicating 80% or higher homology with a full-length or 15 or more<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> consecutive bases of a nucleotide sequence" refers to a homology of, for example, 80% or higher, preferably 90% or higher, and most preferably 95% or higher.</p>

<p id="p0068" num="0068">In addition, the oxidases, genes coding for the oxidases or DNA thereof may also be obtained from various mutant fructosyl peptide oxidases obtained from native fructosyl peptide oxidases.</p>
<p id="p0069" num="0069">Hereinafter, a method for obtaining the genes will be described.</p>
<p id="p0070" num="0070">In order to obtain the genes, a generally employed gene cloning method is used. For example, chromosomal DNA or mRNA is extracted from cells capable of producing the above-described oxidases according to a routine method (e.g., a method described in <nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="b"><text>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (WILEY, Interscience, 1989</text></nplcit>)). Moreover, cDNA can be synthesized using mRNA as a template. Thus, chromosomal DNA or a cDNA library can be obtained. Next, suitable probe DNA is synthesized based on the amino acid sequence of the oxidase,<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> which is used to screen for DNA from the chromosomal DNA or cDNA library. Alternatively, DNA containing a gene fragment of interest is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR method) such as the 5'-RACE or 3'-RACE method by producing suitable primer DNA based on the above-mentioned amino acid sequence. Then, the obtained DNA fragments are linked to obtain DNA containing a full-length gene of the invention. Furthermore, the genes of the invention coding for the oxidases can be obtained from various organisms through hybridization with the above-mentioned probe DNA.</p>

<p id="p0072" num="0072">First, the above-described microorganism is cultured. The obtained cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by physical disruption using, for example, a mortar. From the obtained fine powdery cell debris, chromosomal DNA is extracted according to a general method using a commercially available DNA extraction kit or the like. Then, a total RNA fraction is extracted from the cell debris according to a general method by using a commercially available RNA extraction kit or the like. Then, RNA is collected from this extract through ethanol precipitation. If necessary, a commercially available Oligo dT column is used to fractionate RNA having a poly-A chain according to a general method.</p>
<p id="p0073" num="0073">Next, the oxidase produced from the above-mentioned microorganism is purified, isolated and sequenced to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence thereof. The obtained peptide fragment is digested with trypsin or lysyl-end peptidase to give a peptide fragment, and the amino acid sequence thereof (i.e., the internal amino acid sequence) is determined. Then, considering the information of the obtained partial amino acid sequence and the codon usage frequency of the above-mentioned microorganism, primers are synthesized for PCR. These primers as well as the obtained chromosomal DNA or RNA as a template are used to perform PCR or RT-PCR,<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> thereby obtaining a DNA fragment coding for a part of the oxidase of the invention. Furthermore, primers are appropriately synthesized based on the nucleotide sequence of the obtained DNA fragment.</p>
<p id="p0074" num="0074">Next, using the above-mentioned primers and RNA, cDNA containing the fragment of the present gene is amplified by a suitable RT-PCR method such as the 5'-RACE or 3'-RACE method. The amplified products are linked to obtain cDNA containing a full-length gene. RT-PCR using the RNA as a template and synthesized primers complementary to the 5'- and 3'-terminal sequences can amplify cDNA containing the present gene.</p>

Soil-derived microorganisms were isolated from about 100 soil samples obtained at different places in and around Noda-City (Chiba) and Tsukuba-City (Ibaraki).

<p id="p0102" num="0102">Reaction solution was assayed by HPLC to identify reaction products. First, 50 <i>µ</i>l of reaction solution (2mM fructosyl valyl histidine, 5mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.003U of the inventive oxidase) was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, diluted (10x) and then assayed for the reaction products in a TSK gel Amide-80 column (available from Tosoh Co., Ltd.) .

As a result, a peak was detected only for fructosyl valyl histidine in the control case, while in the enzyme case a peak was detected only for valyl histidine and no peak was detected for fructosyl valyl histidine. From these results, it was confirmed that the inventive oxidase catalyzes the decomposition of fructosyl valyl histidine to produce valyl histidine.

Next, the physiochemical properties of these oxidases were determined. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Each of these 16 strains was cultured on 3 ml of the above-described enzyme inducible medium 1 at 30°C for 4 days and cells were then collected. The cells collected were suspended in 0.9 ml of lysis buffer, disrupted by using a Physcotron and by ultrasonication, added with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%, and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm, 4°C for 10 minutes to collect supernatant which was then used as crude enzyme sample. Each of the crude enzyme samples obtained was examined for its activity for fructosyl valyl histidine (FVH), fructosyl glycine (FG) or ε-fructosyl lysine (sFL). For comparison, activities of each enzyme are shown as % relative activities when compared to its activity for ε-fructosyl lysine (100%). Each crude enzyme sample was heat-treated at 45°C for 10 minutes, and then its activity for fructosyl valyl histidine was determined and compared to the activity before treatment. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, all of these sample strains showed activities on fructosyl valyl histidine though with different levels of activity per medium. Although these samples obtained from different strains exhibited slightly different substrate specificities, the inventive oxidases produced by <i>Eupenicillium terrenum</i> ATCC 18547 and <i>Coniochaeta</i> sp. NISL<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> 9330 (FERM BP-7798) exhibited particularly preferable properties in that they acted well on fructosyl valyl histidine but less on ε-fructosyl lysine.

NISL 9335 (FERM BP-7799) exhibit a relatively strong action on fructosyl valyl histidine. It was also shown that under the above-described heat-treatment conditions, the inventive oxidase samples produced by 12 out of 16 strains exhibited remaining activities of 100% or higher while those produced by the remaining 4 strains exhibited 80-100% remaining activities, which indicated that all of the oxidase samples produced by those 16 strains had extremely high stability.

<p id="p0141" num="0141">Reaction solution was assayed by HPLC to identify reaction products. First, 50 µl of reaction solution (2mM fructosyl valyl histidine, 5mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.003U of the inventive oxidase) was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, diluted (10x) and then assayed for the reaction products in a TSK gel Amide-80 column (available from Tosoh Co., Ltd.). Similarly, a control sample was obtained by using a buffer instead of the enzyme and assayed. As a result, a peak was detected only for fructosyl valyl histidine in the control sample, while in the enzyme sample a peak was detected only for valyl histidine with no peak detected for fructosyl valyl histidine. From these results, it was confirmed that the inventive oxidase catalyzes the decomposition of fructosyl valyl histidine to produce valyl histidine. Further, it was suggested that this reaction cleaved an α-ketoamine bond, as in the glycated amino acid oxidase reaction.</p>

Moreover, each crude enzyme sample was heat-treated at 45°C for 10 minutes and its activity for fructosyl valyl histidine was assayed. The results were compared to the activity obtained before heat-treatment. As shown in Table 3, all the strain samples tested acted on fructosyl valyl histidine and fructosyl glycine, although the level of activity per medium was different depending on the strains. Particularly, two out of the four stains exhibited 2-fold or higher activities, one exhibited 3-fold or higher activity, and the remaining one exhibited even 10-fold or higher activity for fructosyl valyl histidine when compared to their activities for ε-fructosyl lysine. Under the above-described heat-treatment conditions, all of the inventive oxidase samples obtained from the 4 strains exhibited remaining activities of 90% or higher, indicating that they are very stable.

From these results, it was confirmed that the DNA fragment obtained by the above-described RT-PCR amplification contained a portion of the genetic sequence encoding the fructosyl peptide oxidase derived from <i>Eupenicillium terrenum.</i></p>
<heading id="h0078">(5) Analysis of the downstream region by 3'-RACE</heading>
<p id="p0173" num="0173">First, a primer (SEQ ID NO: 17) was designed using the DNA sequence data obtained as described above and synthesized utilizing Amersham Biotech Custom Synthesis Service. This primer, the above-described mRNA and 3'-Full RACE Core Set (available from Takara Bio Inc.) were used to perform RT-PCR to amplify the 3'-unknown region. The reaction solution was subjected to electrophoresis on agarose gel followed by purification and extraction of an about 400bp DNA fragment using Reco Chip (available from Takara Bio Inc.). The DNA fragment purified was then sequenced and analyzed in a DNA sequencer to confirm the presence of the same sequence as the 3' sequence of a portion of the genetic sequence encoding the fructosyl peptide oxidase derived from <i>Eupenicillium terrenum</i> in the 5'-region of the nucleotide sequence determined.</p>
<heading id="h0079">(6) Analysis of the upstream region by 5'-RACE</heading>
<p id="p0174" num="0174">First, primers (SEQ ID NOS: 18-22) were designed using the DNA sequence data obtained as described above and synthesized utilizing Amersham Biotech Custom Synthesis Service. These primers, the above-described mRNA and 5'-Full RACE Core Set (available from Takara Bio Inc.) were used to perform RT-PCR to amplify the 5'-unknown<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> region. The reaction solution was subjected to electrophoresis on agarose gel followed by purification and extraction of an about 600bp DNA fragment using Reco Chip (available from Takara Bio Inc.). The DNA fragment purified was then sequenced and analyzed in a DNA sequencer to confirm the presence of the same sequence as the 5' sequence of a portion of the genetic sequence encoding the fructosyl peptide oxidase derived from <i>Eupenicillium terrenum</i> in the 3'-region of the nucleotide sequence determined.</p>
<heading id="h0080">(7) Obtaining genetic fragments by RT-PCR</heading>
<p id="p0175" num="0175">Translation start and stop codons were deduced from the above-described 3 nucleotide sequences, and primer DNAs (SEQ ID NOS: 23 and 24) for the N- and C-terminal regions were synthesized utilizing Amersham Biotech Custom Synthesis Service. These primers and the above-described mRNA were used to perform RT-PCR. The reaction solution was then subjected to electrophoresis on agarose gel to confirm the presence of an approximately 1.3 kb band. Then, DNA fragment contained in the band was purified and extracted using Reco Chip (available from Takara Bio Inc.). Further, plasmid pUC19 (available from Takara Bio Inc) was digested with restriction enzyme <i>Sma</i>I<i>,</i> and ligated with the DNA fragment purified and extracted as described above. The ligated DNA was then used to transform <i>E. coli</i> JM 109. The obtained plasmid puc-EFP was deposited at the International Patent Organism Depositary, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, an Independent Administrative Institution under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, AIST Tsukuba Central 6, Higashi 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan as FERM BP-8131.</p>
<heading id="h0081">(8) Confirmation of activity</heading>
<p id="p0176" num="0176"><i>E. coli</i> JM 109 (puc-EFP) cells were grown in 10 ml of TY-medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin (1% bactotryptone, 0.5% bactoyeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.0) by shake-culture at 30°C to Klett 100, added with IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM, and cultured for an additional 3 hours. The culture solution was treated in an Ultrasonicgenerator (available from Nissei) for 20 sec. x 4 times while cooling on ice. The culture solution was loaded in a microtube, and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain supernatant and precipitate fractions. The supernatant fraction obtained was transferred to another microtube and determined for fructosyl peptide oxidase activity according to the above-described enzyme activity<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> assay to find that JM109 (puc-EFP) had a fructosyl peptide oxidase activity of 0.01 U/ml.</p>
<heading id="h0082">(9) Analysis of gene encoding fructosyl peptide oxidase</heading>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">Since it was confirmed that <i>E. coli</i> JM109 (puc-EFP) had fructosyl peptide oxidase activity, it became clear that the insert fragment incorporated in pue-EFP contained the gene encoding fructosyl peptide oxidase. Therefore, the nucleotide sequence of the plasmid DNA was determined using a 370A DNA sequencing system (available from Perkin-Elmer Corp.). The nucleotide sequence of the plasmid DNA determined and the putative amino acid sequence of the polypeptide which may be translated from the DNA are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 4 and 3, respectively. The gene encoding fructosyl peptide oxidase had a 1314bp coding region which coded for 437 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p0178" num="0178">According to the present invention, novel fructosyl peptide oxidases with a variety of physicochemical properties and a method for producing them are provided. The inventive fructosyl peptide oxidases are advantageous in that they can be used easily as diagnostic enzymes in an assay kit and that they can be mass-produced at low cost, and are therefore useful in the industry. Further, the present disclosure also provides oxidases which have less action on fructosyl lysine. Those oxidases have improved stability and are particularly useful as enzymes for diagnosing diabetes. The present invention also provides a method for producing those oxidases. In this way, the present disclosure allows for the development of a kit for clinical diagnosis with improved storage stability. Those oxidases with less action on fructosyl lysine are more useful in the industry.<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --></p>
