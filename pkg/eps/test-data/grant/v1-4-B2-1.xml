<heading id="h0001"><u>Technical Field</u></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to detergent compositions containing coated percarbonate bleach, amylase and protease enzymes at narrowly defined ratios, to provide synergistic stain removal performance, in particular on specific stains such as starch-based stains, and blood stains.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">The inorganic perhydrate bleach most widely used in laundry detergent compositions is sodium perborate in the form of either the monohydrate or tetrahydrate. However, concerns about the impact of boron salts on the environment have led to an increasing interest in other perhydrate salts, of which sodium percarbonate is the most readily available.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Detergent compositions containing sodium percarbonate are known in the art. Sodium percarbonate is an attractive perhydrate for use in detergent compositions because it dissolves readily in water, is weight efficient and, after giving up its available oxygen, provides a useful source of carbonate ions for detergency purposes.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">On the-other hand, the use of amylase enzymes in detergent compositions is known, although such use has been mainly described in perborate-based formulations.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The use of enzymes, including amylase in percarbonate-based compositions is known from e.g. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP57028197B"><text>JP 57028197</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9401521A"><text>WO-A-94/01521</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9403554A"><text>WO-A-94/03554</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="DE1940654"><text>DE 1 940 654</text></patcit> relates to enzyme - containing automatic detergents comprising a peroxy conpound wherein such peroxy compound is enveloped in water soluble cellulose ethers and/or esters. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4620936A"><text>US 4, 620, 936</text></patcit> discloses a midly alkaline enzymatic detergent clearing composition adapted for use in automatic dishwashing machines, comprising (a) or anylolytic enzyme, (b) sodium triphosphate, (c) sodium carbonate and/or borax, (d) sodium silicate, (e) a peroxy compound blesch, (f) a stabilising agent, and optionally but preferably (g) a proteolytic enzyme and/or (h) a low- to non-foaming nonionic surfactant and/or (i) a fatty acid having a chain length of C<sub>12-18</sub>, the amounts of components (b), (c) and (d) being so adjusted that the composition will have sufficient builder and buffering capacity to maintain a solution pH of from 9.3 to 10.8. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="EP504091A"><text>EP 504 091</text></patcit> relates to a phosphate - free automatic dishwashing composition comprising nonionic tenside, carboxylic acid, water-soluble alkalin compound and bleach, for excellent tea stain removing ability.<br/>
US 4, 969, 927 is directed to a process for the machine-washing of fabrics according to which a dispersing and diffusing device of the reusable type is filled with a particular product which is active during the washing.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Although the action of amylase on starch-based stains in particular, is known, and the action of percarbonate on bleacheable stains is also known, it has now been surprisingly discovered that the combined use of coated percarbonate, amylase and protease at specific ratios provides a synergistic effect on the removal of difficult stains such as starch-based stains and blood stains, in particular at low temperatures.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition such a synergistic removal effect is also seen on particulate stains such as peat clay, mud, fertilizing soil, high organic content clay.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention is defined in claims 1 to 12.</p>

<heading id="h0012"><u>Nonionic Surfactants</u></heading>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The present laundry detergent compositions preferably also comprise a nonionic surfactant.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">While any nonionic surfactant may be normally employed in the present invention, two families of nonionics have been found to be particularly useful. These are nonionic surfactants based on alkoxylated (especially ethoxylated) alcohols, and those nonionic surfactants based on amidation products of fatty acid esters and N-alkyl polyhydroxy amine. The amidation products of the esters and the amines are generally referred to herein as polyhydroxy fatty acid amides. Particularly useful in the present invention are mixtures comprising two or more nonionic surfactants wherein at Least one nonionic surfactant is selected from each of the groups of alkoxylated alcohols and the polyhydroxy fatty acid amides.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Suitable nonionic surfactants include compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups (hydrophilic in nature) with an organic hydrophobic compound, which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the polyoxyalkylene group which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Particularly preferred for use in the present invention are nonionic surfactants such as the polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, e.g., the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from 6 to 16 carbon atoms, in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration, with from 4 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Preferred nonionics are the water-soluble condensation products of aliphatic alcohols containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, in either straight chain or branched configuration, with an average of up to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Particularly preferred are the condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> from 9 to 15 carbon atoms with from 2 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol; and condensation products of propylene glycol with ethylene oxide. Most preferred are condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from 12 to 15 carbon atoms with an average of 3 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The nonionic surfactant system herein can also include a polyhydroxy fatty acid amide component.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Polyhydroxy fatty acid amides may be produced by reacting a fatty acid ester and an N-alkyl polyhydroxy amine. The preferred amine for use in the present invention is N-(R1)-CH2(CH2OH)4-CH2-OH and the preferred ester is a C12-C20 fatty acid methyl ester. Most preferred is the reaction product of N-methyl glucamine with C12-C20 fatty acid methyl ester.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Methods of manufacturing polyhydroxy fatty acid amides have been described in <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="WO926073A"><text>WO 92 6073</text></patcit>, published on 16th April, 1992. This application describes the preparation of polyhydroxy fatty acid amides in the presence of solvents. In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention N-methyl glucamine is reacted with a C12-C20 methyl ester. It also says that the formulator of granular detergent compositions may find it convenient to run the amidation reaction in the presence of solvents which comprise alkoxylated, especially ethoxylated (EO 3-8) C12-C14 alcohols (page 15, lines 22-27). This directly yields nonionic surfactant systems which are preferred in the present invention, such as those comprising N-methyl glucamide and C12-C14 alcohols with an average of 3 ethoxylate groups per molecule.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Nonionic surfactant systems, and granular detergents made from such systems have been described in <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="WO926160A"><text>WO 92 6160</text></patcit>, published on 16th April, 1992. This application describes (example 15) a granular detergent composition prepared by fine dispersion. mixing in an Eirich RV02 mixer which comprises N-methyl glucamide (10%), nonionic surfactant (10%).</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">Both of these patent: applications describe nonionic surfactant systems together with suitable manufacturing processes for their synthesis, which have been found to be suitable for use in the present invention.</p>
