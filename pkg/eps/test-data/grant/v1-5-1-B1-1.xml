<heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a method for discriminating the genuineness of a certified paper and a discriminating apparatus capable of discriminating genuineness of various certified papers including, for example, bank notes, securities such as stocks and various other certified documents such as slips. There have been conventionally known discriminating apparatuses for discriminating genuineness of bank notes, securities or like certified papers. Such discriminating apparatuses discriminate genuineness of certified paper by photoelectrically scanning characters, figures, symbols, or (hereinafter referred to collectively as "patterns") printed in specified positions of the papers, and comparing a scanned pattern with a prestored pattern of the genuine certified paper.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">However, improved forging technology has made it difficult to discriminate forged certified paper from genuine certified paper only based on usual printed patterns.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">German Unexamined Patent Publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE19708543A1"><text>DE 197 08 543 A1</text></patcit> discloses printing of bank notes with a luminescent ink containing electroluminescent material which emits a light upon application of ultraviolet rays or an alternating voltage. The use of such an electroluminescent ink makes the certified paper luminous upon projection of ultraviolet rays or upon being placed in an alternating-current electromagnetic field and accordingly enables discriminating of genuineness of a certified paper be detecting the presence or absence of the luminous light even if the printed patterns made on the genuine and counterfeit certified papers by usual printing coincides with that of the genuine.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The US patent <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5719984A"><text>US 5,719,984 A</text></patcit> discloses an authentication system for fluorescent imaging and optical character reading. There is provided a scanning mechanism and optical filters to select predetermined wave length of fluorescent light, so the detector may be capable of detecting both fluorescent images and normal visible images.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, a system of detecting a light emitted from the certified paper resulting from a corona discharge by placing the certified paper in an environment of a high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field and discriminating genuineness by comparing a pattern of the detected light emission with a light emission pattern of a genuine certified paper may be added to the above system of optically scanning the printed patterns.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">A discriminating apparatus adopting such a composite system can discriminate genuineness not only based on the light emission from the certified paper caused by the corona discharge, but also based on the printed patterns, i.e. the certified paper is doubly ohecked. Therefore, such a discriminating apparatus is expected to make a highly accurate genuineness discrimination.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In the above composite system, the certified paper is transported to an environment of a high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field set in advance, and a light emitted from and a light reflected by a portion of the certified paper having reached a light collecting spot are detected by a light detecting element. However, with such an arrangement, the certified paper is exposed to the environment of the high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field while passing a sensor for the discrimination, which presents a problem of deteriorating the certified paper.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">In view of the above problem, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for discriminating the genuiness of a certified paper and a certified paper discriminating apparatus which reduces deterioration of the certified paper during discriminating genuiness.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention is directed to a method for discriminating the genuineness of a certified paper according to claim 1 and to a certified paper discriminating apparatus for discriminating genuineness of a certified paper according to claim 5.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the light detecting means detects the reflected light from the certified paper having its wavelength distribution optically split by transporting the certified paper toward the light collecting spot with the light emitted toward the light collecting spot from the light ermitting means. The optically splitting means has such a wavelength selecting property that the light ermitting means detects the light from the fluorescent ink based on a difference in wavelength<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> distribution. The alternating voltage control means outputs a control signal to the alternating voltage applying means only upon confirming the light from the fluorescent ink based on a detection signal from the light detecting means, thereby setting the environment of the alternating-current electromagnetic field at the light collecting spot.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, the genuineness discriminating means discriminates genuineness based on the output values of the light detecting means representing the light ermitted from the light ermitting means and reflected at the light connecting spot and the light ermitted from the fluorescent ink.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">With this construction, the fluorescent ink on the certified paper ermits a light at the light collecting spot set in the environment of the alternating-current electromagnetic field, and this light is detected by the light detecting means, whose corresponding output value is sent to the genuineness discriminating means. Further, the light (fluorescent light) ermitted from the light ermitting means and reflected at the light collecting means is also detected by the light detecting means, whose corresponding output value is sent to the genuineness discriminating of the certified paper based on these two output values, precision of the genuineness discrimination can be improved.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>
<heading id="h0002">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idref="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idref="f0002">2</figref> are perspective views showing one embodiment of a certified paper discriminating apparatus according to the present invention, wherein <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a state where a casing lid is closed and <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows a state where the casing lid is open. <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing one embodiment of an apparatus main body provided in a casing, and <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view showing the assembled apparatus main body. <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a section along A-A of <figref idref="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. It should be noted that, in <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, directions of X-X, Y-Y, -X, +X, -Y and +Y are referred to as widthwise, forward and backward, leftward, rightward, forward and backward directions.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The certified paper discriminating apparatus 1 according to this embodiment discriminates genuineness of bank notes (certified papers) on which characters, figures or symbols are printed using both an electroluminescent ink which emits a light upon being placed in an environment of an alternating-current electromagnetic field and a usual printing ink. The discriminating apparatus 1 is internally provided with a first detecting construction 71 and a second detecting construction 72 to be described in detail later in order to make the above discrimination. The first detecting construction 71 detects electroluminescent light emission in the environment of an alternating-current electromagnetic field, whereas the second detecting construction 72 detects a reflected light from the usual ink.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">As shown in FIGURES, an apparatus main body 2 and a control unit 8 are contained in a box-shaped casing 9 in the discriminating apparatus 1. The casing 9 is comprised of a rectangular parallelepipedic casing main body 91 and a lid 92 provided atop the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> casing main body 91.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">A pair of brackets 93 extending in forward and backward directions are provided at the opposite sides of the upper surface of the casing main body 91 with respect to its widthwise direction. The lid 92 is made displaceable between a closing position shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> where it is placed on the casing main body 91 and an exposing position shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> where it stands at the rear end of the casing main body 91 by rotatably supported about a horizontal axis 94 while having its rear end tightly held between the pair of brackets 93.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">With the lid 92 in its closing position, a note passing slit 95 is defined between the upper surface of the casing main body 91 and the lower surface of the lid 92 as shown in <figref idref="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. When a bank note M is inserted into the note passing slit 95 from the front side of the casing 9, a specified sensor (comprised of a LED 55 and a light detecting element 56 facing the LED 55 as shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) detects it and a driving mechanism is driven in accordance with a drive signal from the control unit 8 sent in response to a detection signal of the sensor to pull the bank note M into the note passing slit 95. Whether or not the inserted bank note M is genuine is discriminated by a discriminating mechanism first and second detecting constructions 71 and 72) contained in the apparatus main body 2 as described later.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idref="f0005">5</figref>, the LED 55 is provided at the widthwise center of the front part of a bottom plate 92a of the lid 92, whereas the light detecting element 56 is provided at a position of a top plate 950 of the casing main body 91 facing the LED 55. With the lid 92 closed, an optical path of the LED 55 is blocked to interrupt the light detection of the light detecting element 56 by the bank note M, thereby detecting the insertion of the bank note M into the note passing slit 95.</p>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">A plurality of guide projections 95a elongated in forward and backward directions are<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> formed on the upper surface of the casing main body 91 of the note passing slit 95, and elongated grooves 95 are formed between adjacent guide projections 95a. These guide projections 95a and the elongated grooves 95b form the top plate 950 of the casing main body 91 as a transport path for the bank note M.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">The plurality of elongated grooves 95b are formed with notches in their front and rear positions, through which notches top parts of transport rollers 95c project. On the other hand, a pair of front and rear auxiliary rollers 95d facing the transport rollers 95c are provided on the rear surface of the lid 92. The bank note M inserted into the note passing slit 95 passes through the note passing slit 95 by the rotation of the transport rollers 95c while being tightly held between the transport rollers 95c and the auxiliary rollers 95d and is discharged to the outside through the rear end of the note passing slit 95.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, a power switch 96 is provided at the front side of the right side surface of the casing main body 91, and a display lamp assembly 98 is provided at a front position of the top of the lid 92. The display lamp assembly 98 is comprised of a ready lamp 98a for displaying whether the discriminating apparatus 1 is in an operable state, a success lamp 98b for displaying whether a discrimination result on genuineness of the bank note M is a success, and a failure lamp 98c for displaying whether the discrimination result on genuineness of the bank note M is a failure. The ready lamp 98a is turned on by turning the power switch 96 on, thereby showing that the apparatus main body 2 is in a state capable of discriminating. While the apparatus main body 2 is undergoing a discrimination process, this ready lamp 98a is turned off, thereby letting an operator know that he should not insert a next bank note until the ready lamp 98a is turned on again.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the apparatus main body 2 includes a sensor unit 20 (mainly<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> comprised of the first and second detecting constructions 71, 72) constructed by integrally making a light detecting element and a light emitting element to be described later, optical members, printed circuit boards into a module; a roller member 3 provided in the casing main body 91; and a sensor casing 4 which is so provided in the lid 92 as to face the outer circumferential surface of the roller member 3 and on which various sensors, circuit boards, etc. are mounted.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The roller member 3 serves as one of electrodes to which an alternating voltage from an alternating-current power supply 30 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) is applied. A light collecting spot P is defined between the top of the roller member 3 and a glass substrate 6 to be described later, and a light from a portion of the bank note M located at the light collecting spot P is incident on a light detecting device 51 to be described later with the bank note M supplied between the roller member 3 and the glass substrate 6. Such a roller member 3 is comprised of a metallic center axis 31 extending in widthwise direction and rotatably supported about its longitudinal axis on specified bearings provided in the casing main body 91, a metallic disk 32 concentrically and integrally fixed to the center axis 31, and an insulating ring 33 made of a material having a high permittivity such as barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) and concentrically pressingly fitted on the metallic disk 32.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">A lead plate 35 is adopted as the other electrode to which the alternative voltage is applied. This lead plate 35 is comprised of a flat lead plate main body 35a and a bent piece 35b formed by bending a front end portion of the lead plate main body 35a downward. The bent piece 35b and an ITO film 66 (an electrically conductive film formed on the bottom surface of the glass substrate 6 by deposition) are electrically connected by an unillustrated conductive paste. The alternating voltage from the alternating-current power supply 30 is applied to the bank note M inserted into the note<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> passing slit 95 via the roller member 3 and the ITO film 66 to create an alternating-current electromagnetic field in the note passing slit 95.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">On the other hand, a rectangular roller fitting window 91a (see <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) is formed in a center position of the top plate 950 of the casing main body 91, and the metallic ring 34 of the roller member 3 projects to the outside through this roller fitting window 91a. The roller member 3 is biased upward by a biasing force from an unillustrated biasing means, whereby the top thereof is located above the guide projections 95a.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">A pattern of stripes extending in the extension of the center axis 31 and having a specified pitch is formed on the entire outer circumferential surface of metallic ring 34, and a photoreflector 36 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) is provided in vicinity of the roller member 3. This photoreflector 36 is so constructed as to project a light onto the outer circumferential surface of the metallic ring 34 and receive the reflected light, and detects a rotating speed of the roller member 3 by detecting a change of the reflected light caused by the stripe pattern.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">The sensor casing 4 is comprised of a casing main body 41 which is square in plan view and has a specified thickness, and a funnel-shaped portion 42 continuously formed below the casing main body 41 and having the shape of an inverted truncated rectangular pyramid. On the other hand, a rectangular window 92b (see <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) corresponding to the funnel-shaped portion 42 is formed in the bottom plate 92a of the lid 92. In the inner surfaces of the rectangular window 92b are formed slanted edge portions 92c corresponding to the inclination of the surrounding wall surfaces of the funnel-shaped portion 42 as shown in <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. The sensor casing 4 fitted into the rectangular window 92b from above is mounted in the lid 92 while having its bottom surface exposed to the outside by the engagement of the surrounding wall surfaces of the funnel-shaped portion 42 with the slanted edge portions 92c.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">The sensor casing 4 has a substrate mounting recess 43 for mounting a substrate 5 to be described later formed in the upper surface of the casing main body 41 while having a glass substrate mounting chamber 44 for mounting the glass substrate 6 to be described later formed in the casing main body 41 such that the chamber 44 vertically penetrates the sensor casing 41. The chamber 44 has its upper part separated into a front section and a rear section by a partition plate 45. A LED mounting chamber 46 for mounting a LED 54 used to discriminate the genuineness of the bank note M is defined in the front (left in <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) section, whereas a light detecting device mounting chamber 47 for mounting the light detecting device 51 is defined in the rear section.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">In the funnel-shaped portion 42 is provided a lead plate mounting recess 48 for mounting the lead plate 35, which recess is adjacent to the rear part of the glass substrate mounting chamber 44. The bent piece 35b of the lead plate 35 is fitted into the lead plate mounting recess 48 and fixed by screws or like means. The bent piece 35 is so dimensioned that its bottom end faces the top plate 950 (see <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) of the casing main body 91 with the lead plate 35 mounted in the sensor casing 4.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">The substrate 5 is used to apply a specified electrical processing to an output of the light detecting device 51 mounted on its rear surface and to enable wiring, etc. for supplying a power to the LED 54. The light detecting device 51 is provided in a specified position of the light detecting device mounting chamber 47, whereas the LED 54 as a light emitting element is provided in a specified position of the LED mounting chamber 46.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">The light detecting device 51 includes light detecting elements 52 for detecting a light from the light collecting spot P, and a plate-shaped element holder 53 for supporting the light detecting elements 52. The light detecting device 51 is mounted on the substrate 5 by fixing the element holder 53 to the rear surface of the substrate 5 via a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> specified coupling member.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">The light detecting elements 52 are comprised of a first light detecting element 52a and a second light detecting element 52b arranged adjacent to each other. The first light detecting element 52a is adapted to detect a light from an electroluminescent material having a characteristic of emitting a light in an alternating-current electromagnetic field, i.e. a so-called electroluminescent light. In order to detect such an electroluminescent light, a band-pass filter 57 for causing only the electroluminescent light to transmit and cutting other lights is placed on the front surface of the first light detecting element 52a. Only the electroluminescent light can be made incident on the first light detecting element 52a by the presence of this band-pass filter 57.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">On the other hand, the second light detecting element 52b is adapted to detect a visible light emitted from the LED 54 and reflected by the surface of the bank note M. In this embodiment, a wavelength of the light emitted from the LED 54 is differed from that of the electroluminescent light.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the glass substrate 6 is formed by joining a first glass substrate 61 and a second glass substrate 62 which are trapezoidal in side view (when the glass substrate 6 is viewed in a direction of -X). The first glass substrate 61 has a first slanted surface 61a formed on its front surface and a second slanted surface 61b formed on its rear surface. The angles of these slanted surfaces are set such that the LED light from the LED 54 incident on the first glass substrate 61 is reflected by the first slanted surface 61a, the bottom surface of the fist glass substrate 61 and the second slanted surface 61b to reach the light collecting spot P. A semitransparent film 61c is formed on the second slanted surface 61b.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">The front surface of the second glass substrate 62 is so slanted as to be held in surface contact with the second slanted surface 61b of the first glass substrate 61, and<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the rear surface thereof is a vertical surface. The glass substrate 6 is formed by placing the front surface of the second glass substrate 62 on the second slanted surface 61b of the first glass substrate 61.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">A light emitted from the LED 54 propagates toward the first slanted surface 61a of the first glass substrate 61 and is reflected thereby to propagate toward the bottom surface of the first glass substrate 61, which bottom surface reflects the light toward the second slanted surface 61b, where the light is reflected by the semitransparent film 61c and propagates downward to be diffusely reflected at the light collecting spot P on the surface of the bank note M. Vertical components of the diffusely reflected light are incident on the light detecting elements 52 after transmitting through the first glass substrate 61, the semitransparent film 61c and the second glass substrate 62. Electrically conductive ITO films 66 formed by depositing ITO (indium-tin-oxide) which is an oxide of an indium-tin alloy are formed on the bottom surface of the glass substrate 6 in contact with the bank note M and the vertical right surface thereof. The ITO films 66 serve as the other electrode facing the roller member 3 as one electrode. In this embodiment, the first detecting construction 71 (see <figref idref="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>) for detecting printing made using the so-called electroluminescent ink containing the electroluminescent material is constructed by the alternating-current power supply 30, the roller member 3, the lead plate 35, the glass substrate 6 and the first light detecting element 52a, and the second detecting construction 72 for detecting printing made by the usual ink on the electroluminescent ink is constructed by the LED 54, the glass substrate 6 and the second light detecting element 52b.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">A genuineness discriminating mechanism according to this embodiment is constructed to discriminate genuineness of the bank note M by comparing detection signals from the first and second detecting constructions 71, 72 obtained with the lapse of time and<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> checking a correlation between the respective detection signals.</p>

Which of the printed protuberant portions M3 is formed does not make any difference in discrimination of genuineness of the bank note M by means of scanning of the light detecting elements 51.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">When the bank note M having such printed protuberant portions M3 formed thereon is inserted into the note passing slit 95 of the discriminating apparatus 1, the unillustrated sensor detects it, the transport rollers 95c are driven by a power supply from the alternating-current power supply in response to the detection signal from the sensor to pull the bank note M to the back of the note passing slit 95, and the LED 54 is driven. The bank note M is inserted between the insulating ring 33 of the roller member 3 and the glass substrate 6 (see <figref idref="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) in this state, passes through the note passing slit 95 while being held in sliding contact with the insulating ring 33 and the glass substrate 6, and is scanned by the light detecting device 51.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p>

The control means 80a judges that a portion of the bank note M emitting the electroluminescent light has reached the light collecting spot P upon receipt of a detection signal from the first light detecting element 52a, outputs a switch-on control signal to the switching circuit 822 to cause the electroluminescent ink portion M31 of the printed protuberant portion M3 to emit a light, and outputs a switch-off control signal to the switching circuit 822 upon judging that the electroluminescent ink portion M31 have moved beyond the light collecting spot P when it stops receiving the detection signal from the first light detecting element 52a. Accordingly, the bank note M is exposed to the environment of the alternating-current electromagnetic field only until the electroluminescent ink portion M31 reaches the light collecting spot P, but not exposed thereto after passing the light collecting spot P by the control of the alternating voltage control means 80a. Thus, deterioration of the bank note M caused by being exposed to the environment of the alternating-current electromagnetic field over a long time can be prevented.

The detected light is judged to be an electroluminescent light if the amount of light is equal to or larger than the specified value (YES in Step S12) and operations in Step S13 and subsequent Steps are carried out. This routine skips to Step S18 if the amount of light is smaller than the specified value.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p>
<p id="p0083" num="0083">In Step 13, the amount of light detected by the second light detecting element 52b is fed to the CPU 80, which in turn discriminates whether the currently obtained amount of light detected by the second light detecting element 52a is equal to or larger than a specified value set beforehand (Step S14).</p>
<p id="p0084" num="0084">A fluorescent light flag is set (Step S15) upon judging that a fluorescent light (light emission distribution at the right side of <figref idref="f0007">FIG. 8A</figref>) is emitted from the surface of the bank note M if the amount of light detected by the second light detecting element 52b is equal to or larger than the specified value (YES in Step S14). On the other hand, an electroluminescent light flag is set (Ste0 S16) upon judging that only an electroluminescent light is emitted from the surface of the bank note M if the amount of light detected by the second light detecting element 52b is below the specified value (NO in Step S14). After the inverter 821 is turned off (Step S17), it is discriminated whether the transport of the bank note M in the note passing slit 95 has been completed (Step S18).</p>
<p id="p0085" num="0085">Unless the transport of the bank note M has been completed (NO in Step S18), this routine returns to Step S6. If it has been completed, the transport motor is stopped in accordance with a signal from the motor control circuit 823 (Step S20) after the LED 54 is turned off (Step S19). The genuineness discriminating means 80b then discriminates the genuineness of the bank note M and outputs a discrimination result to the display lamp assembly 98 (Step S21), thereby ending a series of operations for the genuineness discrimination (Step S22).</p>
<p id="p0086" num="0086">As described in detail above, an alternating voltage is applied to the bank note M only while the electroluminescent ink portion M31 is located at the light collecting spot P. Accordingly, a period during which the bank note M is exposed to the high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field is shortened as compared to a case where it is<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> transported with the environment of the high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field set at the light collecting spot P from the beginning on. This minimizes an influence on the quality of the bank note M caused by a long exposure time, thereby avoiding an undesirable event where deterioration of the bank note M is advanced by the genuineness discrimination.</p>
<p id="p0087" num="0087">Next, an alternative embodiment of the data sampling control by the control unit 8 is described with reference to <figref idref="f0012">FIG. 10B. FIG. 10B</figref> is a flow chart showing a data sampling routine for storing the light emission data of the bank note M scanned by the light detecting element 72 of <figref idref="f0010">FIG.9B</figref>. First, when the data sampling routine is started in Step S1, the CPU 80 of the control unit 8 clears various counters, registers and flags, initializes the respective mechanism and sets the transport mechanism such as the transport rollers 95 in an operation start standby state in accordance with the program called from the ROM 82 (Step S2).</p>
<p id="p0088" num="0088">When the bank note M to be discriminated is inserted into the note passing slit 95 in this state, it is detected by the note detecting sensor 37 (Step S3) and the CPU 80 outputs an operation start signal to the transport mechanism and the bank note M is pulled into the note passing slit 95 by the rotation of the transport rollers 95c (Step S4). If no bank note M is inserted into the note passing slit 95 in Step S3, Step S3 is repeated until the bank note M is inserted into the note passing slit 95.</p>
<p id="p0089" num="0089">Upon the lapse of the predetermined period (period which lapses until the leading end of the bank note M reaches the light collecting spot P) after the detection of the bank note M by the note detecting sensor 37, the switching circuit 391 is turned on in accordance with a control signal from the CPU 80 to supply a power from the alternating-current power supply 39 to the inverter 38 (Step S5), whereby an alternating voltage having a specified voltage value is applied to the roller member 3 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> electrode member 6 to set the environment of the alternating-current electromagnetic field inside the note passing slit 95.</p>
<p id="p0090" num="0090">In Step S6, the monitoring circuit 381 detects a current flowing into the inverter 38 and the detected current value is inputted to the CPU 80 after being digitally converted by the A/D converter 382. If this current value exceeds a threshold value set beforehand, a first timer is started after skipping Step S7. After the lapse of the predetermined period (Step S8), the CPU 80 sends a signal to the switching circuit 391 to turn it off, thereby stopping the inverter 38 (Step S12), stopping the transport of the bank note M (Step S13), and displaying a warning (Step S14) to then end this routine. Such an arrangement hinders application of a voltage higher than necessary to the roller member 3 and the electrode member 6, thereby preventing from deterioration of the roller member 3 and the electrode member 6 from being advanced.</p>
<p id="p0091" num="0091">If the current value is below the threshold value in Step S6, a second timer is started (Step S9) and it is then discriminated whether a pulse from the photoreflector 36 based on the stripe pattern 33a on the outer surface of the insulating ring 33 has been detected (Step S10). If no pulse has been detected, it is discriminated whether a predetermined period has elapsed after the start of the second timer (Step S11). Unless the predetermined period has elapsed, this routine returns to Step S10 to repeat Steps S10 and S11. If the second timer measures the predetermined period while no pulse is detected during the repeated operations of Steps S10 and S11, Step S12 and succeeding Steps are executed to respond to an occurrence of an abnormality upon judgment that the roller member 3 is not rotating, thereby stopping the transport mechanism, displaying a warning and ending this routine. Such an arrangement hinders application of a voltage higher than necessary to the roller member 3 and the electrode member 6 in the absence of the bank note M, thereby preventing<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> deterioration of the roller member 3 and the electrode member 6 from being advanced. On the other hand, if a pulse corresponding to the stripe pattern 33a of the insulating ring 33 from the photoreflector 36 is detected in Step S10, the bank note M in the environment of the high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field emits a light by the corona discharge and the light emission at the light collecting spot P is detected by the light detecting element 72 and inputted to the CPU 80 to be stored in the specified storage device (e.g. RAM 81) (Step S16). Subsequently, the first and second timers are reset (Steps S17, S18), and whether the transport of the bank note M has been completed is discriminated based on whether a pulse signal from the photoreflector 36 has been stopped. This routine is returned to Step S6 to repeat the operations of succeeding Steps during the transport of the bank note M during which the pulse signal is being sent, whereas the inverter 38 is stopped upon judging that the transport of the bank note M has been completed, thereby completing the data sampling for the genuineness discrimination of the bank note M (Step S21).</p>
<p id="p0092" num="0092">As described in detail above, in the inventive discriminating apparatus 1, genuineness is discriminated by detecting the light emitted from the bank note M placed in the environment of the high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field created by the corona discharge. This light is emitted not only from the specified positions where the security mark and the like are printed for the genuineness discrimination, but also from the base portion of the bank note M. By storing a distribution of light emission resulting from the corona discharge over the entire surface of a genuine bank note M beforehand, the inventive discriminating apparatus can more securely discriminate the genuineness of the bank note M than the conventional discriminating apparatuses by comparing the distribution of light emission of the genuine bank note M with that of the bank note M being discriminated by means of the genuineness discriminating means.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p>
<p id="p0093" num="0093">Since the light emission from the bank note M caused by the corona discharge varies depending on the thickness distribution of the bank note M, the presence of various printing inks, and the size of ink particles, etc., forgery of certified papers whose genuineness is difficult to discriminate merely by selecting a printing ink can be suppressed by specifying the thickness distribution of the genuine certified paper and using various printing inks in combination with the thickness distribution. Even if bank notes are forged, such bank notes can be easily and securely discriminated.</p>
<p id="p0094" num="0094"><figref idref="f0013">FIG. 11</figref> is a side view of a second embodiment of the sensor construction. This sensor construction is suited to detecting a security pattern printed by a special printing technique using an ink obtained by mixing a metallic luster ink having a metallic powder as a base into an electroluminescent ink in order to display images and colors which differ depending on angle. Instead of the glass substrate 6 formed by placing the two glass substrates (61, 62) one over the other, a unitary glass prism 60 is used in the sensor casing 4.</p>
<p id="p0095" num="0095">The glass prism 60 has a transversely symmetric pentagonal shape in front view, and is formed with a right slanted surface 60a normal to an optic axis of the LED 54, a ceiling surface 60b horizontally extending from the left end of the right slanted surface 60a in <figref idref="f0013">FIG. 11</figref>, and a left slanted surface 60c extending from the left end of the ceiling surface 60b and symmetrical with the right slanted surface 60a. A solid shape of the glass prism 60 is so set that the light collecting spot P with respect to the bank note M is located at an intersection of a vertically extending center line thereof and the optic axis of the LED 54. The other construction of this sensor construction is similar to that of the previous embodiment.</p>
<p id="p0096" num="0096">The use of such a glass prism 60 enables the presence of the printed protuberant portion M3 (security pattern) to be more effectively detected if the printing pattern is so<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> formed as to change a wavelength depending on direction of reflection and the light detection sensitivity characteristics of the respective light detecting elements 52a, 52b are set to correspond to such a printing pattern.</p>
<p id="p0097" num="0097">Further in this embodiment, the presence of the security pattern is detected in accordance with the output signals from the two light detecting elements 52a, 52b representing the light emitted from the LED 54 and reflected by the bank note M, and the presence of the electroluminescent light is detected by setting the environment of the alternating-current electromagnetic field at the light collecting spot P instead of by stopping the light emission from the LED 54 when the security pattern is detected. Thus, an inconvenience that the bank note M is constantly exposed to the environment of the alternating-current electromagnetic field can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p0098" num="0098">Although the printing pattern is so formed as to change a wavelength depending on direction of reflection in this embodiment, reflection characteristic may be provided with a peculiar distinction or reflection pattern may be differed depending on angle.</p>
<p id="p0099" num="0099">Since the alternating voltage is applied to the certified paper only when the fluorescent ink is located at the light collecting spot, a period during which the certified paper is exposed to the high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field is shortened as compared to a case where it is transported with the environment of the high-voltage alternating-current electromagnetic field set at the light collecting spot P from the beginning on. This minimizes an influence on the quality of the certified paper caused by a long exposure time, thereby avoiding an undesirable situation where deterioration of the bank note M is advanced by the genuineness discrimination.</p>
<p id="p0100" num="0100">Further, the light emitted from the fluorescent ink on the certified paper located at the light collecting spot and the light emitted from the light source and reflected at the light collecting spot are both inputted to the genuineness discriminating means, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> genuineness discriminating means discriminate the genuineness of the certified paper based on these two output values. Therefore, precision of the genuineness discrimination can be improved.</p>
<p id="p0101" num="0101"><figref idref="f0014">FIG.12</figref> is a side view in section showing a second embodiment of the sensor construction. In this embodiment, a pair of upper and lower cylindrical lenses 602, 603 provided with an electrode function are used instead of the roller member 3 used in the foregoing embodiment as an electrode. A corona discharge is created by moving a bank note M while tightly holding it between the upper and lower cylindrical lenses 602, 603 to which a high alternating voltage is applied, and a resulting light emission from the bank note M is detected by a light detecting element via the cylindrical lenses.</p>
<p id="p0102" num="0102">Hereinafter, the second embodiment of the sensor construction is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="f0014">FIG. 12</figref>. This sensor construction is provided with a pair of upper and lower electrode members 6a mounted on facing surfaces of a pair of upper and lower metallic sensor casings 4a, light detecting devices 7 provided at ends of the sensor casings 4a opposite from the electrode members 6a, and an alternating current power supply unit 390 for applying a high alternating voltage to the respective electrode members 6a. The unit 390 includes the alternating-current power supply 39 described above, a switching circuit 39a, an inverter 38, etc.</p>
<p id="p0103" num="0103">Each sensor casing 4a has a tubular shape, holds the electrode member 6a and the light detecting device 7 in specified positions and acts to prevent a high electromagnetic field noise from the power supply unit 390 from influencing a light detecting element 72. Such a sensor casing 4a is formed with a lens mounting recess 401 formed one end surface, a light detecting device mounting recess 402 formed in the other end surface and an optical-path hole 403 between the recesses 401 and 402 for introducing a light having transmitted through the electrode member 6a to the light<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> detecting element 72 of the light detecting device 7.</p>
<p id="p0104" num="0104">Flanges 404 are provided on the outer circumferential surfaces of the respective sensor casings 4a, and coil springs 405 fitted on the sensor casings 4a press the respective flanges 404 toward each other, whereby the upper and lower electrode members 6a provided on the sensor casings 4a to face each other are uniformly and linearly brought into contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p0105" num="0105"><figref idref="f0015">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of the electrode member 6a. As shown in <figref idref="f0015">FIG. 13</figref>, the electrode member 6a is made of a glass material, is long in widthwise direction (direction of X-X) as a whole, and is comprised of a lens portion 601 in the middle, and projecting edges 604 projecting outward (direction of Y-Y) from front and rear edges of the lens portion 601. The electrode member 6a is mounted in the sensor casing 4a by fitting the projecting edges 604 in the lens mounting recess 401.</p>
<p id="p0106" num="0106">The lens portion 601 is comprised of a first lens 602 formed at either one of the upper and lower sides with the projecting edges 604 as a boundary and accommodated in the optical-path hole 403, and a second lens 603 formed at the other side and exposed to the outside. The upper and lower electrode members 6a are so mounted on the respective sensor casings 4a that the second lenses 603 thereof face each other.</p>
<p id="p0107" num="0107">A cylindrical lens forming the second lens 603 is a lens basically having a curvature only in one direction and is arcuate in forward and backward directions while being linear in widthwise direction. Thus, the upper and lower second lenses 60 are in line contact with each other. Contrary to this, the first lens 602 is arcuate not only in forward and backward directions, but also in widthwise direction so that its center portion also projects upward in widthwise direction. Such a shape provides the first lenses 602 with a function of efficiently gathering a light to the corresponding light<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> detecting elements 72.</p>
<p id="p0108" num="0108">A transparent conductive film 62 and a transparent insulating thin film 63 similar to those described above are successively formed on the respective second lenses 603, and the upper and lower transparent conductive films 62 act as electrodes for applying a high alternating voltage to the bank note M tightly held between the upper and lower transparent insulating thin films 63.</p>
<p id="p0109" num="0109">The transparent conductive films 62 are also formed on the entire surfaces of the first lenses 602. By the formation of the transparent conductive films 62, the optical-path 403 of each sensor casing 4a has its three sides covered by conductors to realize an electromagnetically shielded structure in the optical-path hole 403. Such a shielded structure prevents intrusion of external random electromagnetic waves into the optical-path hole 403.</p>
<p id="p0110" num="0110">A metallic thin film 605 electrically connected with the transparent conductive film 62 is formed in a specified position of the outer surface of each projecting edge 604. By connecting the metallic thin film 605 and the power supply unit 390 with each other, a high alternating voltage from the power supply unit 390 is applied to the respective transparent conductive films 62 and, accordingly, a light is emitted from the bank note M tightly held between the upper and lower electrode members 6a caused by a corona discharge. A light collecting spot P for collecting the light from the bank note M is formed at a contact position of the upper and lower transparent insulating films 63. According to the sensor construction of the second embodiment, when the bank note M is fed to between the upper and lower electrode members 6a by the rotation of the transport rollers 95c with a high alternating voltage from the power supply unit 390 applied to the respective electrode members 6a, it enters between the second lenses 603 of the electrode members 6a. Since an environment of a high-voltage alternating-current<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> electromagnetic field is set between the second lenses 603 at this stage, the bank note M is caused to emit a light by the corona discharge and the light from the light collecting spot P is detected by the light detecting element 72 after transmitting through the lens portion 601 to be used for the genuineness discrimination in the procedure described above.</p>
<p id="p0111" num="0111">Since the electromagnetic field generating means does not include a movable portion by adopting the electrode members 6a instead of the roller member 3, the construction of the apparatus can be simplified. Further, since the electrode members 6a are arranged one over the other, the front and rear surfaces of the bank note M can be simultaneously scanned by one operation, thereby eliminating a cumbersomeness of inserting the bank note M having passed through the discriminating apparatus 1 again into the discriminating apparatus after turning it upside down. This leads to an improved operability of the genuineness discrimination.</p>
<p id="p0112" num="0112"><figref idref="f0015">FIG. 14</figref> is a side view in section showing a modified embodiment of the sensor construction of the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="f0014">FIG. 12</figref>. In this embodiment, a mount hole 406 is so formed in one side wall of the sensor casing 4a as to communicate with an optical-path hole 40, and a LED member 600 having a built-in LED chip 600c as a light emitting element is fitted into this mount hole 406. A reflecting surface 600a for reflecting a LED light from the LED chip 600c downward is formed at the top of the leading end of the LED member 600, and a convex lens 600b having its orientation set such that the LED light from the reflecting surface 600a propagates toward the light collecting spot P via the lens portion 601 of the electrode member 6a is provided at the bottom of the leading end of the LED member 600.</p>
<p id="p0113" num="0113">According to this embodiment, the LED light from the LED chip 600c is projected to the light collecting spot P via the reflecting surface 600a, the convex lens 600b of the LED<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> member 600 and the lens portion 601 of the electrode member 6a. Thus, a reflected light from the bank note M located at the light collecting spot P is detected by the light detecting device 7 through the lens portion 601. Therefore, if a wavelength of the LED light emitted from the LED chip 600c is differed from that of the light emitted from the bank note M by the corona discharge, the lights detected by the light detecting device 7 can be distinguished using, for example, a color sensor. As a result, precision in discriminating the genuineness of the bank note M can be improved.</p>
<p id="p0114" num="0114">According to the present invention, the certified paper is placed in the environment of the electromagnetic field where the corona discharge can occur, and genuineness is discriminated by detecting a light emitted therefrom by the light detecting means. By placing the certified paper in the environment of the electromagnetic field where the corona discharge can occur, the light resulting from the corona discharge is emitted from the certified paper. This light is emitted from the entire surface of the certified paper including the base portion thereof. Therefore, by storing a distribution of light emission resulting from the corona discharge over the entire surface of a genuine certified paper in the apparatus beforehand, the genuineness of the certified paper can be securely discriminated by comparing the distribution of light emission of the genuine certified paper with that of the certified paper being discriminated.</p>
<p id="p0115" num="0115">The discriminating apparatus may be further provided with the electromagnetic field generating means for generating an electromagnetic field, the transporting means for transporting the certified paper to cross the electromagnetic field generated by the electromagnetic field generating means, and the certified paper detecting means for detecting the transport of the certified paper in the electromagnetic field, and the light detecting means operates when the certified paper detecting means detects the certified paper. Thus, a distribution of light emission along the transporting direction of<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> the certified paper can be easily obtained by scanning the certified paper by the light detecting means while the transporting means causes the certified paper to cross the environment of the electromagnetic field generated by the electromagnetic field generating means. By transporting the certified paper without moving the light detecting means, scanning can be more easily performed and a scanning construction can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p0116" num="0116">Further, since the light detecting means operates when the certified paper detecting means detects the certified paper, it is not necessary to make switching operations to start and stop the light detecting means every time the certified paper is supplied to and discharged from the environment of the electromagnetic field, thereby improving the operability of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p0117" num="0117">The discriminating apparatus may be further provided with the abnormality detecting means for detecting an abnormality of the certified paper being transported and the stopping means for stopping driving of the electromagnetic field generating means upon detection of an abnormality by the abnormality detecting means. Thus, upon detecting an abnormality such as deterioration of the quality of the certified paper in the environment of the electromagnetic field where a high voltage is applied longer than necessary, driving of the electromagnetic field generating means is stopped by the stopping means, thereby preventing an accident resulting from an abnormality from occurring.</p>
