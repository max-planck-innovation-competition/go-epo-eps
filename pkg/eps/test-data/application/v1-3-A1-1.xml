<heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a portable terminal, and particularly to a portable terminal which can select a closing state in which a first housing and a second housing are laminated so that a back surface of the first housing and a surface of the second housing to each other, and an opening state in which the back surface of the first housing and the surface of the second housing move relatively to each other in parallel thereby to be arranged on different levels.</p>

This portable terminal, by moving the upper housing and the lower housing relatively to each other through a coupling part, can select a closing state in which the upper housing and the lower housing are laminated so that<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> a back surface of the upper housing and a surface of the lower housing face to each other, and an opening state in which the back surface of the upper housing and the surface of the lower housing move relatively to each other in parallel thereby to be arranged on different levels (refer to Patent Document 1).<br/>

<heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h0004">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED IN THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In the conventional portal terminal, based on the thickness dimension determined on the basis of the thickest (or the tallest) electronic component of electronic components housed in the laminated first housing (upper housing) and second housing (lower housing), and specifically on the basis of the display part (LCD) or the electric cell, the first housing and the second housing are formed in the shape of a rectangular solid. Therefore, there is a limit to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reduction of the whole thickness dimension of the portable terminal, and dead space exists.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, in this portable terminal, in the opening state, a step corresponding to the thickness dimension of the first housing is produced between the sub-operational part and the main operational part.<br/>
Since such a step becomes an obstacle in operating the sub-operational part and the main operation part in combination, it is desirable that height of the step is as small as possible.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention has been made in order to meet the aforesaid demands, and it is an object of the invention to provide, in a portable terminal which is put in an opening state from a closing state in which the first housing and the second housing are laminated by moving the opposite surfaces of a first housing and a second housing in parallel, the portable terminal in which the whole thickness can be reduced and the height of the step between the first housing and the second housing in the opening state can be reduced.</p>
<heading id="h0005">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">A portable terminal of the invention includes a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> first housing and a second housing coupled to each other through a coupling part, and takes a closing state in which the first housing and the second housing are superimposed on each other through the coupling part, and an opening state in which the portable terminal extends by sliding the first housing and the second housing. The portable terminal is characterized in that: the first housing is constituted so that a thickness of an end of the first housing in the moving direction when the closing state of the portable terminal changes to the opening state thereof is made thicker than a thickness of an opposite side end; the second housing is constituted so that a thickness of an end of the second housing in the moving direction when the closing state of the portable terminal changes to the opening state thereof is made thinner than a thickness of an opposite side end; in the closing state, the opposite side end of the first housing and the opposite side end of the second housing are superimposed; in the opening state, the opposite side end of the first housing and the end in the moving direction of the second housing are superimposed; and when the closing state changes to the opening state, a gap is formed in the moving direction of the housings by the first housing and the second housing.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, a portable terminal of the invention includes a first housing and a second housing coupled to each other through a coupling part, and takes a closing state in which the first housing and the second housing are superimposed on each other through the coupling part, and an opening state in which the portable terminal extends by sliding the first housing and the second housing. The portable terminal is <b>characterized in that:</b> the first housing includes a first part and a second part which is thicker in the thickness direction than the first part; the second housing includes a third part and a fourth part which is thicker in the thickness direction than the third part; and in the closing state of the portable terminal, the first part of the first housing faces to the fourth part of the second housing, and the second part of the first housing faces to the fourth part of the second housing.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">By providing the fist part and the second part on the back surface of the first housing, the back surface is formed concavo-convexly. By providing the third part and the fourth part on the surface of the second housing, the surface is formed concavo-convexly.<br/>
Since, a key sheet used as a sub-operational part<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> for example is a comparatively thin electronic component, it is arranged in the portion corresponding to the first part of the first housing. On the other hand, since a display part is an electronic component that is thicker than the key sheet, the display part is arranged in the portion corresponding to the second part.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, other portions than the necessary portion can be thinned, and dead space is not produced in the first housing.<br/>
Similarly to in the first housing, also in the second housing, other portions than the necessary portion can be thinned, and dead space is not produced in the second housing.<br/>
The dead space means unnecessary space which is unavailable.<br/>
Hereby, by facing the second part to the third part and facing the fourth part to the first part in the closing state of the portable terminal, the thickness of the portable terminal can be reduced as a whole.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, the thickness of the first part of the first housing can be restrained to the thickness corresponding to the comparatively thin sub-operational part. The operational part (main operational part) is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> provided in the fourth part of the second housing.<br/>
Therefore, in the opening state of the portable terminal, the dimension of the step between the sub-operational part of the first housing and the main operational part (operational part) of the second part can be reduced compared with the conventional dimension.<br/>
Hereby, when the main operational part of the second housing and the sub-operational part of the first housing are operated in combination, smooth operation can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, the sub-operational part is arranged on the first part of the first housing, and the display part is arranged on the portion corresponding to a first projection surface. Further, on the fourth part of the second housing, the operational part (main operational part) is arranged.<br/>
Since the second part is faced to the third part and the fourth part is faced to the first part in the closing state of the portable terminal, the display part and the main operational part of the second housing are not overlapped in the thickness direction. Accordingly, the thickness of the portable terminal can be reduced as a whole.</p><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->
<p id="p0012" num="0012"> In embodiments, the portions corresponding to the first part and the second part are described respectively as a first flat part and a second flat part, and the portions corresponding to the third part and the fourth part are described respectively as a first projection part and a second projection part.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, the portable terminal of the invention includes a first circuit board housed in the first housing, a second circuit board housed in the second housing, and a flexible wiring member which connects the first circuit board and the second circuit board, and is <b>characterized in that</b> the flexible wiring member is arranged in a gap formed between the second part and the fourth part in the opening state of the portable terminal.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In the opening state of the portable terminal, the flexible wiring member is arranged in a gap formed between the first part and the third part.<br/>
Since the flexible wiring member is arranged in the gap which does not appear till the opening state of the portable terminal, the dead space can be reduced compared with the conventional portable terminal. Hereby, the size-reduction and the thickness-reduction of the portable terminal can be obtained.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> -->To the contrary, conventionally, regardless of the closing state or the opening state, the space in which the flexible wire can move was secured. Therefore, this space became the dead space.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">Further, the portable terminal of the invention is <b>characterized in that</b> a wall part which covers sides of the aforesaid gap is provided on one of the first housing and the second housing.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">Since the wall part which covers the sides of the gap is provided on one of the first housing and the second housing, the exposure of the flexible wiring member can be prevented by the wall part in the opening state of the portable terminal thereby to protect the flexible wiring member.<br/>
Further, by providing the wall parts which covers the sides of the gap, good grippable function by user can be secured.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, a portable terminal of the invention includes a first housing and a second housing coupled to each other through a coupling part, a display part provided on a surface of the first housing, and an operational part provided on a surface of the second<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> housing, in which the coupling part includes a rail provided on one of a back surface of the first housing and a surface of the second housing, and an engagement part which is provided on the other of the back surface of the first housing and the surface of the second housing to engage with the rail, and a closing state in which the first housing and the second housing are superimposed on each other through the coupling part, and an opening state in which the portable terminal extends by sliding the first housing and the second housing can be taken by moving the first housing and the second housing relatively to each other through the coupling part. The portable terminal is <b>characterized in that</b>: the first housing includes a first part and a second part which is thicker in the thickness direction than the first part; the second housing includes a third part and a fourth part which is thicker in the thickness direction than the third part; in the closing state of the portable terminal, the first part of the first housing faces to the fourth part of the second housing, and the second part of the first housing faces to the fourth part of the second housing; and an end of the rail is housed in one of the first housing and the second housing.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">Since the end of the rail is housed in one or both<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> of the first housing and the second housing in the invention, the full length of the rail can be set to the large size, so that an enough extension stroke when the portable terminal is put in the opening state can be secured.</p>
<heading id="h0006">ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the portable terminal of the invention, the back surface of the first housing is formed concavo-convexly, the surface of the second housing is formed concavo-convexly, and the concave portions and the convex portions of the housings are faced to each other, whereby the thickness of the portable terminal can be reduced as a whole, and the dimension of the step between the first housing and the second housing in the opening state can be reduced</p>

<p id="p0022" num="0022">Portable terminals according to embodiments of the invention will be described below with reference to drawings.<br/>
As shown in <figref idref="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1A to 3B</figref>, a portable terminal 10 according to a first embodiment includes an upper housing (first housing) 11; a lower housing (second housing) 12; a coupling part 13 which couples the upper housing 11 and the lower housing 12 slidably; a first circuit board 15 housed in the upper housing 11; a display part (LCD) 16, a sub-operational part 17, and a receiver 18 which are provided on a surface 11A of the upper housing 11; a second circuit board 21 housed in the lower housing 12; a main operational part (operational part) 22 and a microphone 23 which are provided on a surface 12A of the lower housing 12; and a flexible printed board<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> (flexible wiring member) 25 which connects the fist circuit board 15 and the second circuit board 21. The portable terminal 10 is a slide type which can take a closing state in which the upper housing 11 and the lower housing 12 are superimposed on each other through the coupling part 13, and an opening state in which the portable terminal 10 is extended by sliding the upper housing 11 and the lower housing 12.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The main operational part 22 and the sub-operational part 17 include a large number of input keys and function keys.<br/>
Though the flexible printed board is indicated as an example of the flexible wiring member 25, the flexible wiring member is not limited to this example but may use the ordinary wiring.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The upper housing 11 has, on its back surface 11A, a first projection part (second part) 27 provided in a position corresponding to the display part 16, and a first flat part (first part) 28 which is adjacent to the first projection part 27 and provided in a position corresponding to the sub-operational part 17.<br/>
In the upper housing 11, its thickness of a leading end portion in the movement direction toward which the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> portable terminal changes from the closing state to the opening state is thicker than the thickness of an opposite side end portion.<br/>
Therefore, in the back surface 11A of the upper housing 11, the first flat part 28 is formed in the concave shape, and the first projection part 27 is formed in the convex shape.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">The lower housing 12 has, on its surface 12A, a second projection part (fourth part) 31 provided in a position corresponding to the main operational part 22, and a second flat part (third part) 32 which is adjacent to the second projection part 31.<br/>
In the lower housing 12, its thickness of a leading end portion in the movement direction toward which the portable terminal 10 changes from the closing state to the opening state is thicker than the thickness of an opposite side end portion.<br/>
Therefore, in the surface 12A of the lower housing 12, the second flat part 32 is formed in the concave shape, and the second projection part 31 is formed in the convex shape.<br/>
The second part 31 has an opening part 34 formed in a portion facing to the second flat part 32</p><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> -->
<p id="p0026" num="0026"> The first projection part 27 and the first flat part 28 of the upper housing 11, and the second projection part 31 and the second flat part 32 of the lower housing 12 are constituted so that the first projection part 27 faces to the second flat part 32 and the second projection part 31 faces to the first flat part 28 in the closing state of the portable terminal 10.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">For the sub-operational part 17, a key sheet is usually used. Since the key sheet used for the sub-operational part 17 is a comparatively thin electronic component, the key sheet is arranged in a portion corresponding to the first flat part 28 of the upper housing 11. On the other hand, since the display part 16 is an electronic component which is thicker than the sub-operational part 17, the display part 16 is arranged in a portion corresponding to the first projection part 27.<br/>
Thus, correspondingly to the thickness dimensions of the sub-operational part 17 and the display part 16, the unevenness is given to the shape of the back surface 11A of the upper housing 11, whereby the portions other than the portion in which the display part 16 is arranged can be thinned, and the dead space can be removed from the upper housing 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Similarly to the upper housing 11, the lower housing 12 can be also slimmed except for the necessary portion, and the dead space can be removed from the lower housing 12.<br/>
Hereby, in the closing state of the portable terminal, the first projection part 27 is faced to the second flat part 32 and the second projection part 31 is faced to the first flat part 28, whereby the thickness of the portable terminal 10 can be reduced as a whole.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Further, the thickness dimension of the first flat part 28 of the upper housing 11 can be restrained to the thickness corresponding to the comparatively thin sub-operational part 17. Therefore, a dimension T1 of a step 36 between the sub-operational part 17 of the upper housing 11 and the main operational part 22 of the lower housing 12 can be made smaller than that in the conventional portable terminal.<br/>
Hereby, when the main operational part 22 of the lower housing 12 and the sub-operational part 17 of the upper housing 11 are operated in combination, smooth operation can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">Further, the sub-operational part 17 is arranged<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> on the first flat part 28 of the upper housing 11, and the display part 16 is arranged in the portion corresponding to the first projection part 27.

In the closing state of the portable terminal 10, the first projection part 27 is faced to the second flat part 32 and the second projection part 31 is faced to the first flat part 28.<br/>
Therefore, the display part 16 and the main operational part 22 of the lower housing 12 are not overlapped in the thickness direction. Accordingly, the thickness of the portable terminal 10 can be reduced as a whole.</p>
