        <heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading>
        <p id="p0004" num="0004">In Patent Document 1, a refrigerant amount in refrigerant charging operation is determined using the degree of supercooling at the condenser outlet of the outdoor unit, assuming that the degree of supercooling can be properly obtained at the condenser outlet of each outdoor unit. However, when refrigerant at the condenser outlet of the outdoor unit is in a two-phase state, no temperature change is shown. Thus, even with a refrigerant specific enthalpy change, such a refrigerant specific enthalpy change cannot be determined, and the degree of supercooling at the condenser outlet of the outdoor unit cannot be properly obtained. As a result, there is a problem that the refrigerant amount in the refrigerant charging operation cannot be properly determined.</p>
        <p id="p0005" num="0005">For this reason, the present invention is intended to properly determine the amount of refrigerant charged to a refrigerant circuit.</p>

            is a diagram of one example of a hardware configuration of the control section 70a. The control section 70a includes a CPU 201, a storage section 202, an input section 203, a display section 204, and a communication section 205. The CPU 201 reads a program stored in the storage section 202 to execute processing. The storage section 202 is used as a primary storage area, such as a main memory or a working area, upon execution of the processing by the CPU 201, and stores data (e.g.,
            <!--  EPO <DP n="7">  -->
            each threshold described later), programs, etc. used upon execution of the processing by the CPU 201. The storage section 202 is one example of a storage medium. The input section 203 is, for example, a button, and receives operation by a user to input such operation to the CPU 201. The display section 204 is, for example, a display, and displays a result of the processing by the CPU 201. The communication section 205 communicates with the outdoor unit 10b etc. via the signal line. The functions and processing of the control section 70a are implemented in such a manner that the CPU 201 executes the processing based on the programs stored in the storage section 202.

            The control section 70a according to the first embodiment performs the processing of balancing a refrigerant amount between the outdoor units 10a, 10b upon refrigerant charging for the air-conditioning device. Upon refrigerant charging, it is necessary to determine whether or not the amount of refrigerant charged to the air-conditioning device is proper. Upon determination on the refrigerant amount, the refrigerant amount needs to be balanced between the outdoor units 10a, 10b. However, in some cases, the balance in the refrigerant amount between the outdoor units is not achieved due to an external factor etc. On the other hand, the air-conditioning device of the present embodiment adjusts the balance in the refrigerant amount by the control of the control section 70a, and in a state in which a proper balance in the refrigerant amount is achieved, determines whether or not the refrigerant amount is proper.

        <p id="p0017" num="0017">Refrigerant charging will be described in advance of the processing of the control section 70a. First, the outdoor units 10a, 10b and the indoor units 40a to 40d are placed, and are connected to each other through the gas pipe 30 and the liquid pipe 31. Note that the outdoor units 10a, 10b are sealed with a predetermined amount of refrigerant. After vacuuming has been performed for the inside of the refrigerant pipe on a side close to the indoor units 40a to 40d, the gas blocking valves 16a, 16b and the liquid blocking valves 17a, 17b of the outdoor units 10a, 10b are opened, and a refrigerant circuit is filled with the refrigerant sealed in the outdoor units 10a, 10b.</p>

After completion of connection, the worker performs the operation of starting refrigerant charging operation for the input section 203 with a valve of the refrigerant tank being opened. When the operation of starting the refrigerant charging operation for the input section 203 is performed, the outdoor units 10a, 10b start the refrigerant charging operation by a signal of the CPU 201. When it is, during the refrigerant charging operation, determined that refrigerant charging is necessary, the CPU 201 transmits a predetermined signal to the refrigerant charging electromagnetic valve 80a. When receiving the predetermined signal, the refrigerant charging electromagnetic valve 80a opens. When the refrigerant charging electromagnetic valve 80a is opened with the valve of the refrigerant tank being opened, the refrigerant circuit is filled with the refrigerant of the refrigerant tank.</p>

            when cooling operation is performed for the outdoor units 10a, 10b and the indoor units 40a, 40b, 40c, 40d. In the cooling operation, the outdoor units 10a, 10b and the compressors 11a, 11b are operated, and the four-way valves 12a, 12b are brought to such a direction that the gas pipe 30 and a compressor suction pipe are connected to each other and the outdoor heat exchangers 13a, 13b and a compressor discharge pipe are connected to each other. The flow of refrigerant is in the same direction between the outdoor units 10a, 10b, and therefore, the outdoor unit 10a will be described as a representative. High-pressure gas refrigerant compressed in the compressor 11a is sent to the four-way valve 12a and the outdoor heat exchanger 13a, and then, by heat exchange with outdoor suction air, is condensed into high-pressure liquid refrigerant. Then, such refrigerant passes through the outdoor expansion valve 14a. At this point, liquid pressure is slightly decreased due to resistance of the expansion valve. Then, the refrigerant is branched into the supercooling bypass pipe 22a and the supercooling circuit 20a. The bypassed liquid refrigerant is depressurized in the supercooling expansion valve 23a, and by heat exchange with the remaining unbypassed liquid refrigerant, is gasified and sent to a compressor suction side. Meanwhile, the unbypassed liquid refrigerant is cooled in the supercooling circuit 20a, and is sent to a supercooling circuit outlet pipe 21a and the liquid pipe 31. Similarly, high-pressure liquid refrigerant is also sent from the outdoor unit 10b to the liquid pipe 31, and joins the unbypassed liquid refrigerant. The refrigerant is used for the cooling operation in each of the indoor units 40a, 40b, 40c, 40d, and turns into low-pressure gas refrigerant. The low-pressure gas refrigerant flowing out of each indoor unit is branched into the compressor suction sides of the outdoor units 10a, 10b through the gas pipe 30, and is compressed and circulates again.

            At S301, the CPU 201 performs the control of balancing the refrigerant amount between the outdoor unit 10a and the outdoor unit 10b. Details of the processing of S301 will be described with reference to

            At S302, the CPU 201 determines, after execution of later-described standby processing, whether or not the refrigerant amount (a charging amount) of the air-conditioning device is proper. The CPU 201 performs, as the standby processing, such control that the outdoor expansion valves 14a, 14b of the outdoor units 10a, 10b are substantially fixedly stabilized at a fixed opening degree (may be the maximum opening degree) and the rotation speeds (the air volumes) of the outdoor fans 15a, 15b are substantially fixedly stabilized at a value corresponding to a cycle state. More specifically, the CPU 201 stands by for a certain period of time. Then, in a stable state, the CPU 201 makes determination on the refrigerant amount of the air-conditioning device. The CPU 201 obtains an average temperature based on the temperature detected by the supercooling circuit outlet temperature sensor 60a of the outdoor unit 10a and a temperature detected by a supercooling circuit outlet temperature sensor 60b of the outdoor unit 10b, and based on whether or not the average temperature is equal to or lower than a preset threshold, determines whether or not the refrigerant amount of the air-conditioning device is proper. In a case where the average temperature is equal to or lower than the threshold, the CPU 201 determines that the refrigerant amount of the air-conditioning device is proper. On the other hand, in a case where the average
            <!--  EPO <DP n="11">  -->
            temperature exceeds the threshold, the CPU 201 determines that the refrigerant amount of the air-conditioning device is not proper. When the CPU 201 determines that the refrigerant amount of the air-conditioning device is not proper (insufficient), the processing proceeds to S303. When the CPU 201 determines that the refrigerant amount of the air-conditioning device is proper, the processing proceeds to S304.

        <p id="p0023" num="0023">At S303, the CPU 201 charges refrigerant to the refrigerant circuit. The CPU 201 sends the predetermined signal to the refrigerant charging electromagnetic valve 80a to open the refrigerant charging electromagnetic valve 80a for a predetermined period of time, thereby charging a predetermined amount of refrigerant to the refrigerant circuit. The predetermined period of time as described herein may be, for example, determined by the CPU 201 etc. according to an external air temperature. Moreover, the predetermined amount is not limited to a fixed amount, and for example, may vary according to one or both of a refrigerant state in the cycle and a tank remaining amount. Then, the CPU 201 returns to the processing of S301, and after the control of balancing the refrigerant amount has been performed, executes S302 to make determination on the refrigerant amount again.</p>

            At S304, the CPU 201 displays, on the display section 204, that the amount of charged refrigerant is proper. When the CPU 201 displays, on the display section 204, that the amount of charged refrigerant is proper, the refrigerant charging control processing ends. When the refrigerant charging control processing ends, refrigerant charging is completed. In a case where the display section 204 displays that the amount of charged refrigerant is proper, the worker detaches, for example, the charging hose from the refrigerant charging port 81a to terminate a refrigerant charging process.

        <p id="p0025" num="0025">Next, the principle of balancing the refrigerant amount between the outdoor units will be described. First, the amount of refrigerant in the outdoor heat exchanger is generally greater as a heat exchanger outlet specific enthalpy decreases, and is greater as the degree of supercooling increases. For this reason, operation is made such that the heat exchanger outlet specific enthalpy or the degree of supercooling is substantially equal among the multiple outdoor units, and therefore, the balance in the refrigerant amount among the multiple outdoor units can be maintained. A factor influencing the refrigerant state at an outlet of the outdoor heat exchanger is the rotation speed of the compressor. The degree of opening of the outdoor expansion valve also influences the refrigerant state at the outlet of the heat exchanger. However, the control section 70a of the first embodiment controls the rotation speed of the compressor providing greater influence to balance the refrigerant amount.</p>

            is a flowchart of one example of refrigerant amount balance control processing of the first embodiment. At S401, the CPU 201 obtains the degree of supercooling at the outlet of the supercooling circuit 20a of the outdoor unit 10a based on a difference between the temperature detected by the supercooling circuit outlet temperature sensor 60a of the outdoor unit 10a and a saturated temperature for the pressure detected by the high-pressure sensor 62a. Moreover, the CPU 201 receives, via the control section 70b, the temperature detected by the supercooling circuit outlet temperature sensor 60b of the outdoor unit 10b and a saturated temperature for a pressure detected by a high-pressure sensor 62b. Then, the CPU 201 obtains the degree of supercooling at an outlet of a supercooling circuit 20b of the outdoor unit 10b based on a difference between the temperature detected by the supercooling circuit

            outlet temperature sensor 60b and the saturated temperature for the pressure detected by the high-pressure sensor 62b. Note that the CPU 201 of the control section 70b may obtain the degree of supercooling at the outlet of the supercooling circuit 20b in the outdoor unit 10b. Then, the CPU 201 of the control section 70a may receive, from the control section 70b, the degree of supercooling at the outlet of the supercooling circuit 20b, the degree of supercooling being obtained by the control section 70b.
        </p>
        <p id="p0027" num="0027">At S402, the CPU 201 determines whether or not a difference between the degree of supercooling at the outlet of the supercooling circuit 20a of the outdoor unit 10a and the degree of supercooling at the outlet of the supercooling circuit 20b of the outdoor unit 10b is equal to or greater than a threshold. In a case where the CPU 201 determines that the difference is equal to or greater than the threshold, the processing proceeds to S403. In a case where the CPU 201 determines that the difference is less than the threshold, the refrigerant amount balance control processing ends.</p>
        <p id="p0028" num="0028">At S403, the CPU 201 obtains an average value of the degree of supercooling based on the degree of supercooling at the outlet of the supercooling circuit 20a of the outdoor unit 10a and the degree of supercooling at the outlet of the supercooling circuit 20b of the outdoor unit 10b. The average value is one example of a target value.</p>
        <p id="p0029" num="0029">
            At S404, the CPU 201 performs the control of decreasing the rotation speed of the compressor 11 of the outdoor unit 10 having a lower degree of supercooling than the average value and increasing the rotation speed of the compressor 11 of the outdoor unit 10 having a higher degree of supercooling than the average value. Although the principle thereof will be described later, the degree of supercooling of the outdoor unit
            <!--  EPO <DP n="14">  -->
            increases as the rotation speed of the compressor decreases, and decreases as the rotation speed of the compressor increases. Thus, by the present processing, a difference in the degree of supercooling among the multiple outdoor units can be decreased.
        </p>
        <p id="p0030" num="0030">The processing of S404 will be described in more details. The CPU 201 determines the rotation speed of each compressor 11 such that the increment of the rotation speed of the compressor 11 of the outdoor unit 10 having a higher degree of supercooling than the average value and the increment of the rotation speed of the compressor 11 of the outdoor unit 10 having a lower degree of supercooling than the average value are equal to each other. Examples of the increment and the increment are two hertzes (Hz). That is, the CPU 201 increases, by two hertzes, the rotation speed of the compressor 11 of the outdoor unit 10 having a higher degree of supercooling than the average value, and decreases, by two hertzes, the rotation speed of the compressor 11 of the outdoor unit 10 having a lower degree of supercooling than the average value. The amount of change in a frequency by the CPU 201 does not depend on the average value and the supercooling degree difference, and is fixed. After the processing of S404, the CPU 201 proceeds to S401.</p>
        <p id="p0031" num="0031">
            A relationship between the degree of supercooling and the rotation speed of the compressor will be described herein. As the rotation speed of the compressor decreases, only a refrigerant circulation amount Gr decreases with almost no change in a heat exchange amount Qc = KA (Tc - Ta) obtained from an air side, and therefore, Hi - Ho increases. An outdoor heat exchanger inlet refrigerant specific enthalpy Hi shows little change, and therefore, an outdoor heat exchanger outlet refrigerant specific
            <!--  EPO <DP n="15">  -->
            enthalpy Ho decreases (see Expression 1). That is, a supercooling circuit inlet refrigerant specific enthalpy decreases (Hsi = Ho), and therefore, in the case of a fixed supercooling circuit capacity Qsc, a supercooling circuit outlet refrigerant specific enthalpy Hso also decreases (see Expression 2). That is, the degree of supercooling increases. Conversely, as the rotation speed of the compressor increases, the degree of supercooling decreases.

That is, a supercooling circuit inlet refrigerant specific enthalpy decreases (Hsi = Ho), and therefore, in the case of a fixed supercooling circuit capacity Qsc, a supercooling circuit outlet refrigerant specific enthalpy Hso also decreases (see Expression 2). That is, the degree of supercooling increases. Conversely, as the rotation speed of the outdoor fan decreases, the degree of supercooling decreases.</p>
