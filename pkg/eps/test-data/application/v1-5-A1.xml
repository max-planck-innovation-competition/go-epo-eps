<p id="p0029" num="0029">The fixed section 221 is fixed relative to the opening of the storage box, and the rotatable section 222 is configured to be rotated around the rotatable section 223 to thereby bring the flexible display panel into being folded.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">In a particular implementation, the fixed section 221 can be fixed at the edge of the opening of the storage box, and for example, the fixed section 221 can be engaged and thus fixed with the edge of the opening of the storage box, and the rotatable section 222 can be rotated around the pivot 223, so the part of the flexible display panel supported by the fixed section 221 is fixed relative to the storage box, and the part thereof supported by the rotatable section 222 can be brought by the rotatable section 222 into being flipped, so that the display device can be laid and flipped. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the pivot 223 can be positioned at L2 as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, or another position, although embodiments of this disclosure will not be limited thereto. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, when the fixed section 221 and the rotatable section 222 at the support layer are flush with each other, the display face of the flexible display panel is flush with the opening of the storage box so that the display device is laid; and as illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>, the rotatable section 222 at the support layer is rotated around the pivot 223 to thereby bring the part of the flexible display panel supported by the rotatable section 222 into being folded, so as to expose the opening of the storage box so that the display device is folded.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">Furthermore, in the vehicular display assembly above according to embodiments of this disclosure, the vehicular display assembly can further include a controller configured to control the rotatable section to be rotated (not illustrated). The controller can control the rotatable section to be rotated so that the display device is switched between the laid and folded states to thereby make it more convenient to operate the vehicular display assembly. Of course, the rotatable section of the support layer can alternatively be rotated manually to thereby control the display device to be switched into the laid or folded state, although the embodiment of this disclosure will not be limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">Optionally, in the vehicular display assembly above according to embodiments of this disclosure, the controller can control the rotatable section to be rotated, by driving it electromagnetically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or using an elastic element or a connection rod. The respective driving modes will not be described below in details, although the driving function of the controller will be described below in details taking a connection rod as an example in embodiments of this disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>, the rotatable section 222 can be driven using a connection rod 50 in a transmission mode, and in a particular implementation, a sliding trail corresponding to the connection rod 50 can be arranged at the edge of the storage<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> box 10, where the connection rod 50 can have one end fixed on the rotatable section 222, and the other end installed on the sliding rail, and the controller can control the connection rod 50 to be moved to thereby control the rotatable section 222 to be rotated around the pivot 223 so as to control the display device to be switched between the laid and folded states.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">Moreover, in order for the driver or the passenger to control conveniently the state of the display device to be switched, in the vehicular display assembly above according to embodiments of this disclosure, the vehicular display assembly can further include a switching switch configured to operatively control the controller to thereby alleviate the driver or the passenger from folding the display device manually, so as to make it more convenient to operate the vehicular display assembly.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Optionally, the switching switch above can be a physical button, or a virtual button in the display device. As illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, and <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>, a physical button 30 can be arranged at the edge of the storage box 10 so that the driver or the passenger intending to take an object out of the box, or to put an object into the box can control the display device 20 to be folded, by pressing down the physical button 30, and can control the display device 20 to resume its laid state, by pressing down the physical button 30 after taking the object out of the box, or putting the object into the box. In some scenario, a private object of the driver may be put into the storage box, so the physical button can alternatively be arranged on a steering wheel for a convenient access of the driver thereto. Moreover, the physical button can alternatively be arranged at another position, although embodiments of this disclosure will not be limited thereto. Moreover the switching switch can alternatively be embodied as a virtual button in the display device, so the driver or the passenger can control the state of the display device to be switched, by touching the virtual button in the touch display device.</p>
