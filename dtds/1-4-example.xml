            A bobby pin includes a clamping ribs unit (2) and a hair fork (3). The clamping rib unit consists of a left
            and a
            right clamping rib member (20,21) interspaced, and the left and the right clamping rib member have a press
            grip
            (201,211) with a shaft hole (202,212) and a guiding groove (203,213). The hair fork has two rods (30)
            extending from
            a base member (31). A shaft (310) stands on the base member, extending in the shaft hole of the press grips
            with a
            spring (4) fitted around the shaft. In using, a user presses the two press grips to open the left and the
            right
            clamping rib member, with the rods of the hair fork shifted and located in the center of the bobby pin.

            unit
            consisting of a left clamping rib member and a right clamping rib member and a press grip formed on the left
            and the
            right clamping rib member respectively, so a user can open widely the left and the right clamping member by
            pushing
            down the press grips, with a hair fork inserted in the space between the left and the right clamping rib
            member, and
            then the left and the right clamping member are closed by releasing the press grips to clamp hair tightly in
            three-dimension way.

            A first conventional bobby pin 10 shown in
            <figref idref="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>
            , includes an upper clamping member 100 and a lower clamping member 101, a left and a right press member 102
            and 103
            formed in a rear portion of the upper and the lower clamping member 100 and 101 respectively. The upper and
            the
            lower press member 102 and 103 are respectively provided sidewise with a shaft base 104 and 105 with a hole
            for a
            shaft 106 to fit through with a torque spring (not shown) fitted around the shaft 106. Then the first
            conventional
            bobby pin can only clamp hair in a line, practically impossible to clamp hair tightly enough, easily to
            permit hair
            slip off the bobby pin.
        </p>
        <p id="p0003" num="0003">
            A second convention bobby pin shown in
            <figref idref="f0002">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>
            includes a left clamping member 110 and a right clamping member 111, and a left and a right press member 112
            and 113
            <!--  EPO <DP n="2">  -->
            formed respectively on the left and the right clamping member 110 and 111, a shaft base 114 and 115
            respectively
            formed on the left and the right clamping member 110 and 111 for a shaft 116 to fit through and with spring
            117
            fitted around the shaft 116. From the
            <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>
            , it can be seen that hair is clamped between the left and the right clamping member 110 and 111 crossing
            each
            other, with a hair fork impossible to be inserted in the bobby pin, resulting in loose clamping to slide off
            the
            bobby pin in the same way as the first conventional bobby pin.
        </p>
        <p id="p0004" num="0004">
            Next, a third conventional bobby pin 12 shown in
            <figref idref="f0003">Figs. 5 and 6</figref>
            includes an upper clamping member 120 and a lower clamping member 121 almost just like the first
            conventional bobby
            pin, but has a larger space between the upper and the lower lamping member 120 and 121 than that of the
            first
            conventional one. Thus, the third conventional bobby pin clamps hair in a line too, with the mass of hair
            clamped
            more than that by the first conventional one, with hair being apt to slide off the upper and the lower
            clamping
            member 120 and 121.
        </p>
        <p id="p0005" num="0005">
            A fourth conventional bobby pin 13 shown in
            <figref idref="f0004">Figs. 7 and 8</figref>
            includes an upper and a lower clamping member 130 and 131 nearly the same as the third conventional bobby
            pin 12,
            except the dimensions of the upper and the lower clamping member 130 and 131 being larger than that of the
            third
            conventional one. So the hair mass clamped between the upper and the lower clamping member 130 and 131 can
            be much
            more that of the third conventional one, also impossible to clamp hair in a solid way as the rest
            conventional bobby
            pins mentioned above.

        <heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
        <p id="p0006" num="0006">
            This invention has been devised to offer a kind of bobby
            <!--  EPO <DP n="3">  -->
            pin, possible to clamp hair tightly in a three-dimension way and have an ornamental effect, with the
            following
            features.
            <ol id="ol0001" compact="compact" ol-style="">
                <li>1. It consists of a left and a right clamping rib member respectively having a plurality of curved
                    ribs
                    arranged to fit in a space between every two ribs mutually, when the left and the right clamping rib
                    member
                    are closed together for clamping hair.
                </li>
                <li>2. It is provided with a hair fork to be positioned in the center of a space between the left and
                    the right
                    clamping rib member for reinforcing clamping function.
                </li>
                <li>3. The left and the right clamping rib member respectively have a press grip, and a user pushes down
                    the
                    press grips to open the left and the right clamping unit, with a guiding groove in the press grips
                    clamping
                    a correct rod of the hair fork to adjust the hair fork just positioned in the center of the space
                    between
                    the left and the right clamping unit. Then the left and the right clamping unit are closed to clamp
                    hair
                    quite tightly with cooperation of the hair fork and the bobby pin can have a decorative effect.

            The clamping rib unit 2 is composed of a left clamping rib member 20 and a right clamping rib member 21, and
            the
            left and
            <!--  EPO <DP n="5">  -->
            the right clamping member 20 and 21 respectively have a plurality of curved ribs 200 and 210 arranged spaced

            adjacent ribs
            210 of the right clamping rib member 201 when they are closed. Further the left and the right clamping rib
            member 20
            and 21 are respectively provided with a press grip 201 and 211 formed symmetrically in an end, and a shaft
            hole 202
            and 212 are respectively formed in the press grip 202 and 212 respectively as shown in
            <figref idref="f0008">Fig. 15</figref>
            . Further, the press grips 201 and 211 have a correct groove 203 and 213 respectively in an inner surface as
            shown
            in
            <figref idref="f0006">Figs. 12</figref>

            The hair fork 3 is provided with two rods spaced apart 30 and a base member 31. The rods 30 extend out from
            the base
            member 31, and a shaft 310 is formed integral to stand upright on the base member 31, fitting in the shaft

            and 41
            extending to push against the inner surface of the press grips 201 and 211 so that the left and the right
            clamping
            rib member 20 and 21 can elastically and automatically be pushed back to close after opened. Then the bobby
            pin 10
            can maintain clamping function with ease. In addition, the base member 31 has a correct block 311 sidewise
            on the
            rear end. So when a user presses down the press grids 201 and 211 to force the left and the right clamping
            rib
            member 20 and 21 open, the correct grooves 203 and 213 can clamp the correct block 311 therein, so that the
            hair
            fork 3 can be adjusted to position just in the center of the space between the left and the

        <p id="p0011" num="0011">
            In handling the bobby pin 10, a user first inserts the hair fork 3 in a topknot 5 as shown In

            , and then the curved ribs 200 and 210 of the left and the right clamping rib member 20 and 21 are opened by
            pressing the press grips 201, 211, moved into hair, and then released the press grips 201 and 211 to let the
            two
